abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies
  and economies worldwide. There remains an ongoing need for high-performance SARS-CoV-2
  tests which may be broadly deployed for infection monitoring. Here we report a highly
  sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay in development for detection
  of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood and
  saliva. In all matrices in the studies conducted to date we observe textgreater98%
  negative percent agreement and textgreater90% positive percent agreement with molecular
  testing for days 1–7 in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals.
  N-protein load decreases as anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG increases, and N-protein levels
  correlate with RT-PCR Ct-values in saliva, and between matched saliva and capillary
  blood samples. This Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay effectively detects SARS-CoV-2
  infection via measurement of antigen levels in blood or saliva, using non-invasive,
  swab-independent collection methods, offering potential for at home and point of
  care sample collection.
