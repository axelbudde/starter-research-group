abstract: Introduction During the current COVID-19 pandemic video consultations are
  increasingly common in order to minimize the risk of infection for staff and patients.
  The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a spine examination via
  video.  Methods A total of 43 patients were recruited. Each participant underwent
  a video-based (VB) and a conventional face-to-face (FTF) spine examination. Pain
  intensity, active range of motion, inspection, a neurophysiologic basic exam and
  provocations tests were evaluated using video-based and face-to-face methods.  Results
  The intra-rater reliability (IRR) was measured between both examinations. Good to
  very good IRR values were obtained in inspection (Kappa between 0,752 und 0,944),
  active range of motion and basic neurophysiological examination (Kappa between 0,659
  und 0,969). Only moderate matches were found in specific provocation tests (Kappa
  between 0,407 und 0,938). A video-based spine examination is a reliable tool for
  measuring pain intensity, active range of motion and a basic neurophysiologic exam.  Conclusion
  A basic spine examination during a video consultation is possible. A good agreement
  of the test results between video-based and face-to-face examination could be found.
