abstract: In 2019, the EPMA celebrated its 10th anniversary at the 5th World Congress
  in Pilsen, Czech Republic. The history of the International Professional Network
  dedicated to Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM / 3PM) is rich
  in achievements. Facing the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic it is getting evident
  globally that the predictive approach, targeted prevention and personalisation of
  medical services is the optimal paradigm in healthcare demonstrating the high potential
  to save lives and to benefit the society as a whole. The EPMA World Congress Supplement
  2020 highlights advances in 3P medicine.
