abstract: Abstract We describe a multifactorial investigation of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
  in a large meat processing complex in Germany. Infection event timing, spatial,
  climate and ventilation conditions in the processing plant, sharing of living quarters
  and transport, and viral genome sequences were analyzed. Our results suggest that
  a single index case transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to co-workers over distances of more
  than 8 m, within a confined work area in which air is constantly recirculated and
  cooled. Viral genome sequencing shows that all cases share a set of mutations representing
  a novel sub-branch in the SARS-CoV-2 C20 clade. We identified the same set of mutations
  in samples collected in the time period between this initial infection cluster and
  a subsequent outbreak within the same factory, with the largest number of confirmed
  SARS-CoV-2 cases in a German meat processing facility reported so far. Our results
  indicate climate conditions, fresh air exchange rates, and airflow as factors that
  can promote efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 via long distances and provide insights
  into possible requirements for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace
  settings.
