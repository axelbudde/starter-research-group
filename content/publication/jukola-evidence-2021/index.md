abstract: 'Calls for evidence-based approaches to COVID-19 have sparked up discussions
  on the use of evidence for policy. In this note, we expand these discussions: while
  the debate has mostly focused on the types of evidence to be used for policy, we
  argue that the assessment of judgments involved in data practices and evidence production
  should play a central role in evaluating policy.'
