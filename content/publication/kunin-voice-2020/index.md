abstract: Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills
  reflecting both—the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters
  and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological
  alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include
  but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal
  alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory
  disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders,
  underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand,
  it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading
  pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders,
  diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study
  revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker
  to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed
  to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population
  might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications
  under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed
  microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI
  were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their
  functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies
  are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial
  intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive
  machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal
  health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using
  derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals
  in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free
  nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected
  in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the
  phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient
  profiling.
