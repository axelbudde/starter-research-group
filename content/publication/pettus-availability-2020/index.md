abstract: Section 2 of the 2019 World Health Organization Model List of Essential
  Medicines includes opioid analgesics formulations commonly used for the control
  of pain and respiratory distress, as well as sedative and anxiolytic substances
  such as midazolam and diazepam. These medicines, essential to palliative care, are
  regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations
  specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws. Those
  national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally
  Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs). The complex interaction between national
  regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic)
  directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care. Despite decades
  of global civil society advocacy in the United Nations system, ICEMs have remained
  chronically unavailable, inaccessible, and unaffordable in low- and-middle-income
  countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in high-income countries as
  well. The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness,
  anxiety, agitation, and delirium. Frequently used medicines include opioids such
  as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs. This paper describes
  the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during
  the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries
  of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.
