abstract: The number of people suffering from the new coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 continues
  to rise. In SARS‐CoV‐2, superinfection with bacteria or fungi seems to be associated
  with increased mortality. The role of co‐infections with respiratory viral pathogens
  has not yet been clarified. Here, we report the course of COVID‐19 in a CLL patient
  with secondary immunodeficiency and viral co‐infection with parainfluenza.
