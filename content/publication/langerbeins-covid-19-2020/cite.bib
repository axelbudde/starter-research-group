In SARS‐CoV‐2, superinfection with bacteria or fungi seems to be associated with increased mortality. The role of co‐infections with respiratory viral pathogens has not yet been clarified. Here, we report the course of COVID‐19 in a CLL patient with secondary immunodeficiency and viral co‐infection with parainfluenza.},
