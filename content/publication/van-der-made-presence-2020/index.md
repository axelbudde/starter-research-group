abstract: 'Importance: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can occur in younger,
  predominantly male, patients without preexisting medical conditions. Some individuals
  may have primary immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe infections caused
  by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To explore
  the presence of genetic variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies among
  young patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of
  pairs of brothers without medical history meeting the selection criteria of young
  (age textless35 years) brother pairs admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due
  to severe COVID-19. Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs
  of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final
  date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic
  variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments. Exposure:
  Severe COVID-19. Main Outcome and Measures: Results of rapid clinical whole-exome
  sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic
  genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated
  from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects. Results:
  The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of
  major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency
  due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration
  of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay
  was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing
  of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function
  variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited
  4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected
  members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383GtextgreaterT; p.[Val795Phe]).
  In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type
  I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by
  significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation
  with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The
  production of IFN-Î³, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation
  with imiquimod. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of 4 young male patients
  with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7
  were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses.
  These preliminary findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19.'
