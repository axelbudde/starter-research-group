abstract: Chronic liver disease management is a comprehensive approach requiring multi-professional
  expertise and well-orchestrated healthcare measures thoroughly organized by responsible
  medical units. Contextually, the corresponding multi-faceted chain of healthcare
  events is likely to be severely disturbed or even temporarily broken under the force
  majeure conditions such as global pandemics. Consequently, the chronic liver disease
  is highly representative for the management of any severe chronic disorder under
  lasting pandemics with unprecedented numbers of acutely diseased persons who, together
  with the chronically sick patient cohorts, have to be treated using the given capacity
  of healthcare systems with their limited resources. Current study aimed at exploring
  potentially negative impacts of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak on the quality of the advanced
  chronic liver disease (ACLD) management considering two well-classified parameters,
  namely, (1) the continuity of the patient registrations and (2) the level of mortality
  rates, comparing pre-COVID-19 statistics with these under the current pandemic in
  Slovak Republic. Altogether 1091 registrations to cirrhosis registry (with 60.8%
  versus 39.2% males to females ratio) were included with a median age of 57 years
  for patients under consideration. Already within the very first 3 months of the
  pandemic outbreak in Slovakia (lockdown declared from March 16, 2020, until May
  20, 2020), the continuity of the patient registrations has been broken followed
  by significantly increased ACLD-related death rates. During this period of time,
  the total number of new registrations decreased by about 60% (15 registrations in
  2020 versus 38 in 2018 and 38 in 2019). Corresponding mortality increased by about
  52% (23 deaths in 2020 versus 10 in 2018 and 12 in 2019). Based on these results
  and in line with the framework of 3PM guidelines, the pandemic priority pathways
  (PPP) are strongly recommended for maintaining tertiary care uninterrupted. For
  the evidence-based implementation of PPP, creation of predictive algorithms and
  individualized care strategy tailored to the patient is essential. Resulting classification
  of measures is summarized as follows:The Green PPP Line is reserved for prioritized
  (urgent and comprehensive) treatment of patients at highest risk to die from ACLD
  (tertiary care) as compared to the risk from possible COVID-19 infection.The Orange
  PPP Line considers patients at middle risk of adverse outcomes from ACLD with re-addressing
  them to the secondary care. As further deterioration of ACLD is still probable,
  pro-active management is ascertained with tertiary center serving as the 24/7 telemedicine
  consultation hub for a secondary facility (on a physician-physician level).The Red
  PPP Line is related to the patients at low risk to die from ACLD, re-addressing
  them to the primary care. Since patients with stable chronic liver diseases without
  advanced fibrosis are at trivial inherent risk, they should be kept out of the healthcare
  setting as far as possible by the telemedical (patient-nurse or patient- physician) measurements.,
  The assigned priority has to be monitored and re-evaluated individually—in intervals
  based on the baseline prognostic score such as MELD. The approach is conform with
  principles of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM) and demonstrates
  a potential of great clinical utility for an optimal management of any severe chronic
  disorder (cardiovascular, neurological and cancer) under lasting pandemics.
