abstract: The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus
  SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2-S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing
  the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated
  selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2-S.
  The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the interaction
  of CoV2-S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and specific
  inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new
  vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the
  ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates
  and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of
  particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are
  currently being reported.
