abstract: Hydroxychloroquine is being investigated for a potential prophylactic effect
  in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but its
  mechanism of action is poorly understood. Circulating leukocytes from the blood
  of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show increased responses to Toll-like
  receptor ligands, suggestive of trained immunity. By analyzing interferon responses
  of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors conditioned with heat-killed
  Candida, trained innate immunity can be modeled in vitro. In this model, hydroxychloroquine
  inhibits the responsiveness of these innate immune cells to virus-like stimuli and
  interferons. This is associated with a suppression of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation
  and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation of inflammation-related genes, changes in
  the cellular lipidome, and decreased expression of interferon-stimulated genes.
  Our findings indicate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity in vitro,
  which may not be beneficial for the antiviral innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2
  infection in patients.,    PBMCs of COVID-19 patients show increased responses to
  Toll-like receptor ligands   Trained immunity is modeled in vitro using Candida-trained
  PBMCs   Hydroxychloroquine inhibits changes in lipidome and histone modifications   Hydroxychloroquine
  dampens the trained response to interferons and viral stimuli   , Peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients show increased responses to Toll-like
  receptor ligands, suggestive of innate immune reprogramming. Rother et al. show
  that hydroxychloroquine inhibits the interferon response of Candida-trained PBMCs
  from healthy donors in vitro and blocks associated changes in lipidome and histone
  modifications.
