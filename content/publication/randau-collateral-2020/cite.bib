The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in private practices and hospitals in Germany.

Design
In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted from April 2th to April 16th 2020.

Setting
The survey was conducted among 15.0000 of 18.000 orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, both in private practices and hospitals.

Participants
All members of the German Society of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) and the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (BVOU). were invited by e-mail to participate in the survey.

Main outcome measures
Out of 50 questions 42 were designed to enquire a certain dimension of the pandemic impact and contribute to one of six indices, namely “Preparedness”, “Resources”, “Reduction”, “Informedness”, “Concern”, and “Depletion”. Data was analyzed in multiple stepwise regression, aiming to identify those factors that independently influenced the indices.

Results
858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices for “Preparedness”, “Resources”, and “Informedness” and an independent negative predictor regarding “Depletion”. Self-employment was found to be an independent positive predictor of the financial index “Depletion”. Female surgeons were identified as an independent variable for a higher level of “Concern”.

Conclusions
The study confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals.

What are the new findings
The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty. Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial consequences.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future
Political and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals.},
