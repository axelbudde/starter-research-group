abstract: Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19
  pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in private practices and hospitals in
  Germany.  Design In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey
  was conducted from April 2th to April 16th 2020.  Setting The survey was conducted
  among 15.0000 of 18.000 orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, both in private
  practices and hospitals.  Participants All members of the German Society of Orthopedic
  and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) and the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma
  Surgery (BVOU). were invited by e-mail to participate in the survey.  Main outcome
  measures Out of 50 questions 42 were designed to enquire a certain dimension of
  the pandemic impact and contribute to one of six indices, namely “Preparedness”,
  “Resources”, “Reduction”, “Informedness”, “Concern”, and “Depletion”. Data was analyzed
  in multiple stepwise regression, aiming to identify those factors that independently
  influenced the indices.  Results 858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated
  in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed
  at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices
  for “Preparedness”, “Resources”, and “Informedness” and an independent negative
  predictor regarding “Depletion”. Self-employment was found to be an independent
  positive predictor of the financial index “Depletion”. Female surgeons were identified
  as an independent variable for a higher level of “Concern”.  Conclusions The study
  confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery
  in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite
  severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment
  (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons
  are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than
  surgeons working in hospitals.  What are the new findings The COVID-19 pandemic
  has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty.
  Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial
  consequences.  How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future Political
  and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field
  of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special
  emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more
  affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working
  in hospitals.
