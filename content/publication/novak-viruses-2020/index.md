abstract: Viral infections and atopic diseases are closely related and contribute
  to each other. The physiological deficiencies and immune mechanisms that underlie
  atopic diseases can result in a suboptimal defense against multiple viruses and
  promote a suitable environment for their proliferation and dissemination. Viral
  infections, on the other hand, can induce per se several immunological mechanisms
  involved in allergic inflammation capable to promote the initiation or exacerbation
  of atopic diseases such as atopic asthma. In a world that is affected more and more
  by factors that significantly impact the prevalence of atopic diseases, coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID‐19) induced by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory
  syndrome (SARS‐CoV‐2) is having an unprecedented impact with still unpredictable
  consequences. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to revise the available scientific
  literature regarding the association between common respiratory viruses and asthma,
  as well as the newly emerging data about the molecular mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection and its possible relation with asthma, to better understand the interrelation
  between common viruses and asthma and its potential meaning on the current global
  pandemic of COVID‐19.
