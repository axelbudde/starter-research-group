abstract: • TeleNP represents a medium through which clinical research and important
  clinical care can continue.   • We discuss benefits, challenges, and practical considerations
  in the use of teleNP.   • We describe how the Australian Epilepsy Project has adapted
  to the COVID-19 environment.   • TeleNP data acquired to date reveals deficits typical
  of those observed in epilepsy.   • TeleNP presents an opportunity to expand the
  reach and breadth of neuropsychological services.
