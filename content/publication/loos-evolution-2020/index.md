abstract: A critical step to ending the spread of the novel severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the ability to detect, diagnose, and understand
  why some individuals develop mild and others develop severe disease. For example,
  defining the early evolutionary patterns of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and
  whether prevalent coronaviruses or other common infections influence the evolution
  of immunity, remains poorly understood but could inform diagnostic and vaccine development.
  Here, we deeply profiled the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and how it is influenced
  by other coinfections. Our data suggest an early and rapid rise in functional humoral
  immunity in the first 2 weeks of infection across antigen-specific targets, which
  is negligibly influenced by cross-reactivity to additional common coronaviruses
  or common respiratory infections. These data suggest that preexisting receptor binding
  domain-specific immunity does not influence or bias the evolution of immunity to
  SARS-CoV-2 and should have negligible influence on shaping diagnostic or vaccine-induced
  immunity., The novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused
  over 17 million infections in just a few months, with disease manifestations ranging
  from largely asymptomatic infection to critically severe disease. The remarkable
  spread and unpredictable disease outcomes continue to challenge management of this
  infection. Among the hypotheses to explain the heterogeneity of symptoms is the
  possibility that exposure to other coronaviruses (CoVs), or overall higher capability
  to develop immunity against respiratory pathogens, may influence the evolution of
  immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we profiled the immune response across multiple coronavirus
  receptor binding domains (RBDs), respiratory viruses, and SARS-CoV-2, to determine
  whether heterologous immunity to other CoV-RBDs or other infections influenced the
  evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response. Overall changes in subclass,
  isotype, and Fc-receptor binding were profiled broadly across a cohort of 43 individuals
  against different coronaviruses—RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and the more common HKU1 and
  NL63 viruses. We found rapid functional evolution of responses to SARS-CoV-2 over
  time, along with broad but relatively more time-invariant responses to the more
  common CoVs. Moreover, there was little evidence of correlation between SARS-CoV-2
  responses and HKU1, NL63, and respiratory infection (influenza and respiratory syncytial
  virus) responses. These findings suggest that common viral infections including
  common CoV immunity, targeting the receptor binding domain involved in viral infection,
  do not appear to influence the rapid functional evolution of SARS-CoV-2 immunity,
  and thus should not impact diagnostics or shape vaccine-induced immunity., IMPORTANCE
