abstract: For testing the effectiveness of air purification devices in regard to the
  reduction of virus-containing aerosols, a test method involving test viruses has
  been lacking until now. The use of bacteriophages (phiX174 phages) is a method to
  test the efficiency of air purification devices under experimental conditions. Using
  air purifiers with a HEPA filter H14, a 4.6–6.1 Log reduction of test viruses can
  be achieved if bacteriophages are directly aerosolised into the air purifier, which
  corresponds to a reduction of 99.9974–99.9999%. Due to the complexity and individuality
  of air flow, an experimental approach was used in which all outside influences were
  minimised. The experimental setup was practical and chosen to project a scenario
  of direct transmission by an emitting source to a recipient. The experiments were
  performed with and without the air purifier at a distance of 0.75 m and 1.5 m each.
  Using the air purifier at a setting of 1000 m3/h, the concentration of the phiX174
  phages in the air could be reduced by 2.86 Log (mean value). Nevertheless, the experiments
  without the air purifier showed a similar reduction rate of 2.61 Log (mean value)
  after 35 min. The concentration of phiX174 phages in the air could be additionally
  reduced up to 1 log step (maximum value) by the use of the air purifier in comparison
  to the experiments without. Distance was shown to be an important factor for risk
  reduction.
