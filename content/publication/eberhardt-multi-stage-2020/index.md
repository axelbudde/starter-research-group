abstract: Background SARS-CoV-2 test kits are in critical shortage in many countries.
  This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and
  isolate infected individuals.  Objective Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage
  group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple
  stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with
  a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable
  savings of resources.  Study design We designed and parameterized various multi-stage
  testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using
  computer simulations.  Results We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool
  sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals
  with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively.
  We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based
  on the expected prevalence rate.  Conclusion These group testing schemes could lead
  to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale
  population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
