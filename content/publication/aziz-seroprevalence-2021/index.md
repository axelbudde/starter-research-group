abstract: 'To estimate the seroprevalence and temporal course of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
  antibodies, we embedded a multi-tiered seroprevalence survey within an ongoing community-based
  cohort study in Bonn, Germany. We first assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin
  G levels with an immunoassay, followed by confirmatory testing of borderline and
  positive test results with a recombinant spike-based immunofluorescence assay and
  a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Those with a borderline or positive
  immunoassay result were retested after 4 to 5 months. At baseline, 4771 persons
  participated (88% response rate). Between April 24th and June 30th, 2020, seroprevalence
  was 0.97% (95% CI: 0.72−1.30) by immunoassay and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21−0.61) when
  considering only those with two additional positive confirmatory tests. Importantly,
  about 20% of PRNT+ individuals lost their neutralizing antibodies within five months.
  Here, we show that neutralizing antibodies are detectable in only one third of those
  with a positive immunoassay result, and wane relatively quickly.'
