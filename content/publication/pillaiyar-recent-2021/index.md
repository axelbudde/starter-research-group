abstract: 'Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect both humans and animals. In humans, CoVs can
  cause respiratory, kidney, heart, brain, and intestinal infections that can range
  from mild to lethal. Since the start of the 21st century, three Î²-coronaviruses
  have crossed the species barrier to infect humans: severe-acute respiratory syndrome
  (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV).
  These viruses are dangerous and can easily be transmitted from human to human. Therefore,
  the development of anticoronaviral therapies is urgently needed. However, to date,
  no approved vaccines or drugs against CoV infections are available. In this review,
  we focus on the medicinal chemistry efforts toward the development of antiviral
  agents against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, targeting biochemical events important
  for viral replication and its life cycle. These targets include the spike glycoprotein
  and its host-receptors for viral entry, proteases that are essential for cleaving
  polyproteins to produce functional proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for
  viral RNA replication.'
