abstract: 'Background: Due to the corona pandemic, we conducted the Heidelberg module
  of the Master of Medical Education (MME) study program, which focuses on teaching
  and assessment of communicative and interpofessional skills, digitally for the first
  time., Method: We outsourced the teaching to a pre-module phase in the weeks upfront.
  During the module week, the lecturers picked up again and deepened the topics and
  the participants created, revised and simulated a virtual OSCE course. , Results/Conclusion:
  Evaluation and reflection of the module showed that the digital implementation including
  an OSCE examination can be an appropriate alternative to a classroom-based training.
  However, important elements of the MME program that provide networking possibilities
  and personal exchange can only be replicated in the digital environment to a limited
  extent. In the future, sensibly applied digital components can be used to enrich
  the study program.'
