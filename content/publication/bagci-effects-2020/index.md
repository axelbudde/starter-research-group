abstract: Maternal circadian rhythms provide highly important input into the entrainment
  and programming of fetal and newborn circadian rhythms. The light-dark cycle is
  an important regulator of the internal biological clock. Even though pregnant women
  spend a greater part of the day at home during the latter stages of pregnancy, natural
  light exposure is crucial for the fetus. The current recommended COVID-19 lockdown
  might dramatically alter normal environmental lighting conditions of pregnant women,
  resulting in exposure to extremely low levels of natural daylight and high-intensity
  artificial light sources during both day and night. This article summarizes the
  potential effects on pregnant woman and their fetuses due to prolonged exposure
  to altered photoperiod and as consequence altered circadian system, known as chronodisruption,
  that may result from the COVID-19 lockdown.
