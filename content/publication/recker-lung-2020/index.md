abstract: In the current coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, certain patients are becoming
  seriously ill. Lung pathologies are common, and some patients even go on to develop
  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires intubation and artificial
  respiration of the critically ill patient. Imaging of the lung is absolutely necessary
  to obtain a diagnosis, assess the course of disease and for treatment. Particularly
  in gynecology and obstetrics (OBGYN), ultrasound scans of the lung can be a useful
  additional tool when caring for pregnant patients in the delivery room. As obstetricians
  use ultrasound imaging a lot in routine clinical practice, in the current pandemic
  setting, routine prenatal imaging screening could be expanded by the addition of
  ultrasound scans of the lung. Lung sonography can offer important additional information,
  particularly in obstetrics where the indications for radiation-emitting imaging
  are particularly restrictive. If there is a sonographic suspicion of lung involvement,
  then, depending on the symptoms and the morphological extent of the ultrasound findings,
  it may be necessary to consider admitting the patient to hospital for close fetal
  and maternal monitoring.
