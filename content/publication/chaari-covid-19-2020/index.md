abstract: Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies
  around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken
  from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised,
  and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic
  scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and
  vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers
  of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from
  those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution
  as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a
  minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave
  has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner
  of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this
  country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective
  strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large
  number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions
  such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly
  heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative
  analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable “real-time” monitoring based on
  the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the
  most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may
  lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection
  of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection
  of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations
  are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised
  (3P) medical approach.
