abstract: Background A decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events and catheter
  laboratory activation was reported for the United States and Italy during the initial
  stage of the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020. We report on the deployment of emergency
  services for cardiovascular events in a defined region in western Germany during
  the government-imposed lock-down period.  Methods We examined 5799 consecutive patients
  who were treated by emergency services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19
  pandemic (January 1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding
  time frame in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians’ records provided by nine
  locations in the area, we found a 20% overall decline in cardiovascular admissions.  Results
  The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the government-imposed
  social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in discretionary
  admissions for dizziness/syncope (-53%), heart failure (-38%), exacerbated COPD
  (-28%) and unstable angina (-23%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation
  myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were
  unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for patients ≥60
  years. There was also a greater reduction in emergency admissions for those living
  in urban areas compared to suburban areas.  Conclusions During the Covid-19 pandemic,
  a significant decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events was observed
  during the government-enforced shutdown in a predefined area in western Germany.
  This reduction in admissions was mainly driven by “discretionary” cardiovascular
  events (unstable angina, heart failure, exacerbated COPD and dizziness/syncope),
  but events in which admission was unavoidable (CPR, STEMI and stroke) did not change.
