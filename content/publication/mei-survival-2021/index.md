abstract: 'Background Elderly patients infected with COVID-19 are reported to have
  a substantially increased risk of mortality. Clinical characteristics, treatment
  options, and potential survival factors remain under investigation. This study aimed
  to fill this gap and provide clinically relevant factors associated with survival
  of elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods In this multi-center study, elderly patients
  (age ≥65 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 4 Wuhan hospitals were
  included. The clinical end point was hospital discharge or deceased with last date
  of follow-up on Jul. 08, 2020. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were collected.
  Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to analyze survival and risk
  factors. A metabolic flux analysis using a large-scale molecular model was applied
  to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 regarding metabolism pathways. Results
  A total of 223 elderly patients infected with COVID-19 were included, 91 (40.8%)
  were discharged and 132 (59.2%) deceased. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  developed in 140 (62.8%) patients, 23 (25.3%) of these patients survived. Multivariate
  analysis showed that potential risk factors for mortality were elevated D-Dimer
  (odds ratio: 1.13 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.22], p=.005), high immune-related metabolic index
  (6.42 [95% CI 2.66 - 15.48], p&lt;.001), and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
  ratio (1.08 [95% 1.03 - 1.13], p&lt;.001). Elderly patients receiving interferon
  atmotherapy showed an increased probability of survival (0.29 [95% CI 0.17 - 0.51],
  p&lt;.001). Based on these factors, an algorithm (AlgSurv) was developed to predict
  survival for elderly patients. The metabolic flux analysis showed that 12 metabolic
  pathways including phenylalanine (odds ratio: 28.27 [95% CI 10.56 - 75.72], p&lt;0.001),
  fatty acid (15.61 [95% CI 6.66 - 36.6], p&lt;0.001), and pyruvate (12.86 [95% CI
  5.85 - 28.28], p&lt;0.001) showed a consistently lower flux in the survivors versus
  deceased. This may reflect a key pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion
  Several factors such as interferon atmotherapy and recreased activity of specific
  metabolic pathways were found to be associated with survival of elderly patients.
  Based on these findings, a survival algorithm (AlgSurv) was developed for clinical
  stratification of elderly patients. Dysregulation of the metabolic pathways revealed
  here may aid in the drug and vaccine development against COVID-19.'
