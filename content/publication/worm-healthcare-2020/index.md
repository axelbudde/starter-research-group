abstract: 'The population prevalence of insect venom allergy ranges between 3–5%,
  and it can lead to potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Patients who
  have experienced a systemic allergic reaction following an insect sting should be
  referred to an allergy specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Due to the widespread
  reduction in outpatient and inpatient care capacities in recent months as a result
  of the COVID-19 pandemic, the various allergy specialized centers in Germany, Austria,
  and Switzerland have taken different measures to ensure that patients with insect
  venom allergy will continue to receive optimal allergy care. A recent data analysis
  from the various centers revealed that there has been a major reduction in newly
  initiated insect venom immunotherapy (a 48.5% decline from March–June 2019 compared
  to March–June 2020: data from various centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland).
  The present article proposes defined organizational measures (e.g., telephone and
  video appointments, rearranging waiting areas and implementing hygiene measures
  and social distancing rules at stable patient numbers) and medical measures (collaboration
  with practice-based physicians with regard to primary diagnostics, rapid COVID-19
  testing, continuing already-initiated insect venom immunotherapy in the outpatient
  setting by making use of the maximal permitted injection intervals, prompt initiation
  of insect venom immunotherapy during the summer season, and, where necessary, using
  outpatient regimens particularly out of season) for the care of insect venom allergy
  patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.'
