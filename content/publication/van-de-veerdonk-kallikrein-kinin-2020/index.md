abstract: COVID-19 patients can present with pulmonary edema early in disease. We
  propose that this is due to a local vascular problem because of activation of bradykinin
  1 receptor (B1R) and B2R on endothelial cells in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 enters the
  cell via ACE2 that next to its role in RAAS is needed to inactivate des-Arg9 bradykinin,
  the potent ligand of the B1R. Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the
  ligands of B1R, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading
  to angioedema. Here, we hypothesize that a kinin-dependent local lung angioedema
  via B1R and eventually B2R is an important feature of COVID-19. We propose that
  blocking the B2R and inhibiting plasma kallikrein activity might have an ameliorating
  effect on early disease caused by COVID-19 and might prevent acute respiratory distress
  syndrome (ARDS). In addition, this pathway might indirectly be responsive to anti-inflammatory
  agents.
