abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis confronted us, like many
  researchers worldwide, with an unforeseen challenge during the final stages of a
  randomized controlled trial involving ataxia patients. Institutional guidelines
  suddenly no longer allowed regular follow-up visits to take place, impeding the
  clinical evaluation of long-term outcomes. Here, we discuss the various scenarios
  that we considered in response to these imposed restrictions and share our experience
  of home video recording by dedicated, extensively instructed family members. Albeit
  somewhat unconventional at first glance, this last resort strategy enabled us to
  reliably assess the study’s primary endpoint at the predefined point in time and
  hopefully encourages researchers in other ongoing ataxia trials to continue their
  activities. Remote assessments of ataxia severity may serve as a reasonable substitute
  in interventional trials beyond the current exceptional situation generated by the
  COVID-19 pandemic, but will require further investigation.
