abstract: Background In times of a pandemic threat, such as COVID-19, and the need
  for reduced direct doctor-patient contact, internet-based telemedicine has attracted
  more and more attention as a surrogate service. Suspending the diagnosis and treatment
  of non-virus related diseases for longer periods of time is not a viable option
  since this would only exacerbate problems on the patient and national level. The
  need for alternative treatment modalities increased rather quickly. So far, telemedical
  applications have mainly focused on teleradiological diagnosis, follow-up and monitoring
  of psychiatric and internal diseases, as well as geriatric patient care. As far
  as these authors are aware, orthopaedic physical examination of the knee joint,
  including trauma work-up, has not been the subject of any studies to date. This
  feasibility study explores how video consultation can be designed and implemented
  in the context of history taking and physical examination in knee joint complaints.  Material
  and Method 21 patient actors (PA) with simulated complaints of the knee joint were
  examined individually for each diagnosis, first via video consultation and then
  directly by a specialist (SP). One PA group has a medical background, the other
  was made up of laypersons. The time was measured for both types of consultation.
  The physician documented the detected symptoms, the quality of implementation of
  the self-examination steps, and the derived diagnosis on an assessment form. After
  completion of both consultation sessions, the PAs were handed a questionnaire on
  the respective examination modality.  Results With the video consultation the examination
  lasted 8.63 (± 2.5) minutes on average and with the regular consultation in person
  5.63 (± 1.7) minutes (p  Conclusion The video consultation for musculoskeletal complaints
  of the knee joint allows exploratory remote examination and helps to minimise the
  number of patients in hospitals and practices. It takes longer for the physician
  to perform and does not permit functional testing for ligament injuries of the knee
  joint. In its present form, telemedical examination is not able to fully replace
  personal consultation.
