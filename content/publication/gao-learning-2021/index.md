abstract: We describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity
  of Cytotoxic-T-Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from diverse pathogens including
  SARS-CoV-2. The model was trained and optimized on the relative immunodominance
  of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Its accuracy was tested
  against experimental data from COVID-19 patients. Our model predicts that only some
  SARS-CoV-2 epitopes predicted to bind to HLA molecules are immunogenic. The immunogenic
  CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population
  coverage, but those from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so.
  Our model also predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical
  to seasonal coronaviruses circulating in the population and such cross-reactive
  CD8+ T cells can indeed be detected in prepandemic blood donors, suggesting that
  some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals prior
  to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
