abstract: textlessh2textgreaterAbstracttextless/h2textgreatertextlessh3textgreaterObjectivestextless/h3textgreatertextlessptextgreaterOne-fifth
  of Covid-19 patients suffer a severe course of Covid-19 infection; however, the
  specific causes remain unclear. Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Although
  only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired
  MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes,
  and an estimated prevalence of 17%. This paper describes a novel conjecture explaining
  how MCAS might cause a propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic
  post-Covid-19 illnesses.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterMethodstextless/h3textgreatertextlessptextgreaterObservations
  of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS were compared with extensive clinical
  experience with MCAS.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterResultstextless/h3textgreatertextlessptextgreaterThe
  prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected
  population. Much of Covid-19's hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation
  which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators
  have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the
  authors' treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone
  mortality.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterConclusionstextless/h3textgreatertextlessptextgreaterHyperinflammatory
  cytokine storms in many severely symptomatic Covid-19 patients may be rooted in
  an atypical response to SARS-CoV-2 by the dysfunctional MCs of MCAS rather than
  a normal response by normal MCs. If proven, this theory has significant therapeutic
  and prognostic implications.textless/ptextgreater
