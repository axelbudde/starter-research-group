abstract: textlessbrtextgreaterPandemics like COVID-19 warrant an urgent implementation
  of the one health surveillance (OHS) system to the focus on multisectoral, multidisciplinary,
  multi-institutional, and multispecialty coordination, in all aspects of the response
  to outbreaks that might involve humans, animals, and their environment. The Indian
  system so far has evolved in conducting surveillance and monitoring of parameters
  within the domain of human health, animal health, and the environment, but in silos.
  This commentary piece provides an opinion to boost the existing surveillance activities
  for early detection and ways to develop an integrated OHS to prevent future COVID-19
  like pandemics in India. It also attempts to provide possible solutions at the interface
  of human–animal–environment, from the simpler to the complex system integration
  with the principles of one health.textlessbrtextgreater
