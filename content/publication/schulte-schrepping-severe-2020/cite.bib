 abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and respiratory failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated immune responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DRhiCD11chi inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DRlo monocytes. Our study provides detailed insights into the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals profound alterations in the myeloid cell compartment associated with severe COVID-19., 


•
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces profound alterations of the myeloid compartment


•
Mild COVID-19 is marked by inflammatory HLA-DRhiCD11chi CD14+ monocytes


•
Dysfunctional HLA-DRloCD163hi and HLA-DRloS100Ahi CD14+ monocytes in severe COVID-19

Emergency myelopoiesis with immature and dysfunctional neutrophils in severe COVID-19


, Analysis of patients with mild and severe COVID-19 reveals the presence of dysfunctional neutrophils in the latter that is linked to emergency myelopoiesis.},
