abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract
  infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and respiratory
  failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis
  of severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated
  immune responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined
  single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole-blood and peripheral-blood
  mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation
  in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DRhiCD11chi
  inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated
  in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors,
  as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DRlo
  monocytes. Our study provides detailed insights into the systemic immune response
  to SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals profound alterations in the myeloid cell compartment
  associated with severe COVID-19.,    • SARS-CoV-2 infection induces profound alterations
  of the myeloid compartment   • Mild COVID-19 is marked by inflammatory HLA-DRhiCD11chi
  CD14+ monocytes   • Dysfunctional HLA-DRloCD163hi and HLA-DRloS100Ahi CD14+ monocytes
  in severe COVID-19   • Emergency myelopoiesis with immature and dysfunctional neutrophils
  in severe COVID-19   , Analysis of patients with mild and severe COVID-19 reveals
  the presence of dysfunctional neutrophils in the latter that is linked to emergency
  myelopoiesis.
