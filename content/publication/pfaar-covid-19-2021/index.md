abstract: 'Background: After the beginning and during the worldwide pandemic caused
  by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), patients
  with allergic and atopic diseases have felt and still feel insecure. Currently,
  four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the Paul Ehrlich Institute
  in Germany, and vaccination campaigns have been started nationwide. In this respect,
  it is of utmost importance to give recommendations on possible immunological interactions
  and potential risks of immunomodulatory substances (monoclonal antibodies, biologicals)
  during concurrent vaccination with the approved vaccines. Materials and methods:
  This position paper provides specific recommendations on the use of immunomodulatory
  drugs in the context of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations based on current literature.
  Results: The recommendations are covering the following conditions in which biologicals
  are indicated and approved: 1) chronic inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis,
  chronic spontaneous urticaria), 2) bronchial asthma, and 3) chronic rhinosinusitis
  with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic spontaneous
  urticaria are not at increased risk for allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination.
  Nevertheless, vaccination may result in transient eczema exacerbation due to general
  immune stimulation. Vaccination in patients receiving systemic therapy with biologicals
  can be performed. Patients with severe asthma and concomitant treatment with biologicals
  also do not have an increased risk of allergic reaction following COVID-19 vaccination
  which is recommended in these patients. Patients with CRSwNP are also not known
  to be at increased risk for allergic vaccine reactions, and continuation or initiation
  of a treatment with biologicals is also recommended with concurrent COVID-19 vaccination.
  In general, COVID-19 vaccination should be given within the interval between two
  applications of the respective biological, that is, with a time-lag of at least
  1 week after the previous or at least 1 week before the next biological treatment
  planned. Conclusion: Biologicals for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, chronic
  spontaneous urticaria, bronchial asthma, and CRSwNP should be continued during the
  current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. However, the intervals of biological treatment
  may need to be slightly adjusted (DGAKI/AeDA recommendations as of March 22, 2021).'
