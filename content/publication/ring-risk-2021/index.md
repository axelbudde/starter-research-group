abstract: Since the introduction of active vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  there has been a debate about the risk of developing severe allergic or anaphylactic
  reactions among individuals with a history of allergy. Indeed, rare cases of severe
  allergic reactions have been reported in the United Kingdom and North America. By
  february 2021 a rate of 4,5 severe allergic reactions occurred among 1 million patients
  vaccinated with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which is higher than the generally
  expected rate of severe allergic reactions to vaccinations of around 1 in 1 million.
