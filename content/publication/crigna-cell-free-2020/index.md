abstract: Interest in the use of cell-free nucleic acids (CFNAs) as clinical non-invasive
  biomarker panels for prediction and prevention of multiple diseases has greatly
  increased over the last decade. Indeed, circulating CFNAs are attributable to many
  physiological and pathological processes such as imbalanced stress conditions, physical
  activities, extensive apoptosis of different origin, systemic hypoxic-ischemic events
  and tumour progression, amongst others. This article highlights the involvement
  of circulating CFNAs in local and systemic processes dealing with the question,
  whether specific patterns of CFNAs in blood, their detection, quantity and quality
  (such as their methylation status) might be instrumental to predict a disease development/progression
  and could be further utilised for accompanying diagnostics, targeted prevention,
  creation of individualised therapy algorithms, therapy monitoring and prognosis.
  Presented considerations conform with principles of 3P medicine and serve for improving
  individual outcomes and cost efficacy of medical services provided to the population.
