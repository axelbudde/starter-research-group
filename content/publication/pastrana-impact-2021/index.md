abstract: 'Objective With over two million deaths and almost 100 million confirmed
  cases, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a “tsunami of suffering.” Health care workers,
  including palliative care workers, have been severely impacted. This study explores
  how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted palliative care workers around the world
  and describes the coping strategies they have adopted to face their specific situation.  Method
  We conducted a qualitative analysis of written, unstructured comments provided by
  respondents to a survey of IAHPC members between May and June 2020. Free text was
  exported to MAX QDA, and a thematic analysis was performed by reading the comments
  and developing a coding frame.  Results Seventy-seven palliative care workers from
  41 countries submitted at least one written comment, resulting in a data corpus
  of 10,694 words and a total of 374 coded comments. Eight main themes are emerged
  from the analysis: palliative care development, workforce impact, work reorganization,
  palliative care reconceptualization, economic and financial impacts, increased risk,
  emotional impact, and coping strategies.  Significance of results The pandemic has
  had a huge impact on palliative care workers including their ability to work and
  their financial status. It has generated increased workloads and placed them in
  vulnerable positions that affect their emotional well-being, resulting in distress
  and burnout. Counseling and support networks provide important resilience-building
  buffers. Coping strategies such as team and family support are important factors
  in workers’ capacity to adapt and respond. The pandemic is changing the concept
  and praxis of palliative care. Government officials, academia, providers, and affected
  populations need to work together to develop, and implement steps to ensure palliative
  care integration into response preparedness plans so as not to leave anyone behind,
  including health workers.'
