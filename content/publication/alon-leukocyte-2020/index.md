abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
  agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding of the fundamental processes
  underlying the versatile clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is incomplete without
  comprehension of how different immune cells are recruited to various compartments
  of virus-infected lungs, and how this recruitment differs among individuals with
  different levels of disease severity. As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte
  recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by
  specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it
  results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs.
  In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models,
  our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and
  epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete.
  However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory
  responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection
  and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby
  blood vessels. Here, we review the molecular signals orchestrating leukocyte trafficking
  to airway and lung compartments during primary pneumotropic influenza virus infections
  and discuss potential similarities to distinct courses of primary SARS-CoV-2 infections.
  We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the
  airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in
  subsets of patients with COVID-19. These multiple molecular pathways are potential
  targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with severe COVID-19., In this
  Perspective, Alon and colleagues discuss how insights into immune cell trafficking
  during pneumotropic influenza virus infections may inform our understanding of immune
  cell recruitment to the respiratory tract in patients with coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19). Moreover, they examine the emerging knowledge of vascular pathologies
  beyond the lung caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
