abstract: When facing an emerging virus outbreak such as severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a quick reaction time is key to control the
  spread. It takes time to develop antivirals and vaccines, and implement vaccination
  campaigns. Therefore, preventive measures such as rapid isolation of cases and identification
  and early quarantine of cases’ close contacts—as well as masks, physical distancing,
  hand hygiene, surface disinfection and air control—are crucial to reduce the risk
  of transmission. In this context, disinfectants and antiseptics with proven efficacy
  against the outbreak virus should be used. However, biocidal formulations are quite
  complex and may include auxiliary substances such as surfactants or emollients in
  addition to active substances. In order to evaluate disinfectants’ efficacy objectively,
  meaningful efficacy data are needed. Therefore, the European Committee for Standardisation
  technical committee 216 ‘Chemical disinfectants and antiseptics’ Working Group 1
  (medical area) has developed standards for efficacy testing. The European tiered
  approach grades the virucidal efficacy in three levels, with corresponding marker
  test viruses. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, disinfectants with proven activity against
  vaccinia virus, the marker virus for the European claim ‘active against enveloped
  viruses’, should be used to ensure effective hygiene procedures to control the pandemic.
