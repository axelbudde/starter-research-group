abstract: The objective of the current survey was to assess the awareness of the dental
  professionals according to the principals described by the Turkish Dental Association
  (TDA). A questionnaire including the socio-demographic data, specialties/academic
  degree, institutions/affiliations, the knowledge about COVID-19, the number of patients
  examined and dental treatments performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the knowledge
  of protection based on the guidelines described by TDA, contamination with COVID-19
  and the psychological complaints has been used. A total of 947 (63.1%) dentists
  enrolled the study. The results showed satisfactory knowledge about the COVID-19
  etiology, mode of transmission and the pre-procedural cautions as the majority of
  them had a fair level of knowledge with significantly higher knowledge among specialized
  respondents. The participants have also recorded a good judgment towards performing
  the emergency dental treatment during the current COVID-19 pandemic which corresponds
  with the guidelines determined by TDA. Considering the updates on the transmission
  of COVID-19 and protective strategies, there is an urgent need for improvement of
  dentists’ knowledge about risk assessment via training programs. The incidence of
  positive testing among dental professionals also necessitates immediately testing
  of asymptomatic Turkish dental professionals.
