abstract: • Predictive genetic testing of an asymptomatic person has considerable
  potential to predict future risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity.   •
  Risk alleles for COVID-19 severity due to the pleiotropic effects are associated
  with performance-related traits.   • Team sport, power, and combat athletes possess
  a higher genetic risk for COVID-19 severity than untrained subjects or endurance
  athletes.   • Polygenic risk scores based on 6 gene polymorphisms show a significant
  geographical variation, putting some countries at greater risk than others.
