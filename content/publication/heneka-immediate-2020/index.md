abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that infection with Sars-CoV-2 causes neurological
  deficits in a substantial proportion of affected patients. While these symptoms
  arise acutely during the course of infection, less is known about the possible long-term
  consequences for the brain. Severely affected COVID-19 cases experience high levels
  of proinflammatory cytokines and acute respiratory dysfunction and often require
  assisted ventilation. All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline.
  Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction,
  acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction
  of a neurodegenerative disease. This article summarizes the current understanding
  of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may
  be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary COVID-19
  infection. A structured prospective evaluation should analyze the likelihood, time
  course, and severity of cognitive impairment following the COVID-19 pandemic.
