abstract: Cardiac injury and dysfunction occur in COVID-19 patients and increase the
  risk of mortality. Causes are ill defined but could be through direct cardiac infection
  and/or inflammation-induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective
  drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with
  phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory
  “cytokine-storm”, a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1β, and poly(I:C),
  induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along
  with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs)
  and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal
  family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac
  dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases
  transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces
  SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates
  to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage., COVID-19 causes cardiac injury, although
  mechanisms and effective therapeutics are lacking. In this study, Mills et al.,
  show that cytokines elevated in COVID-19 patients drive cardiac dysfunction. These
  responses are mapped using phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing, enabling
  a targeted drug screen to identify therapeutics for rapid repurposing. BET inhibitors
  were identified as leading candidates to block cardiac dysfunction and decrease
  SARS-CoV-2 cardiac infection.
