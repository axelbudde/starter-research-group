abstract: Introduction Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the German Health Ministry
  has issued restrictions applying to the field of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.
  Besides postponement of elective surgeries, outpatient consultations have been drastically
  reduced. Parallel to these developments, an increase in telemedical consultations
  has reflected efforts to provide sufficient patient care. This study aims to evaluate
  the feasibility of a clinical examination of the hip joint and pelvis by way of
  a telemedical consultation.  Materials and Methods Twenty-nine patients of a German
  university clinic were recruited and assessed in both telemedical and conventional
  examinations. Agreement between the two examinations was then assessed, and connections
  between the observed agreement and patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and
  ASA classification were investigated.  Results The inspections agreed closely with
  a mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.76 ± 0.37. Palpation showed adequate agreement with a
  mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.38 ± 0.19. Function showed good agreement with a mean Cohenʼs
  kappa of 0.61 ± 0.26 and range of motion showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohenʼs
  kappa of 0.36 ± 0.19. A significant positive correlation was observed between the
  number of deviations in the different examinations and age (p = 0.05), and a significant
  positive correlation was shown between the number of non-feasible examinations and
  age (p  Discussion Inspection and function can be reliably evaluated, whereas the
  significance of palpation, provocation and measurement of range of motion is limited.
  The small sample size puts limitations on the significance of a statistically relevant
  correlation between patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification
  score and valid and successful implementation of a telemedical examination. The
  authors recommend targeted patient selection. If, however, patients are being evaluated
  who are very old (textgreater 75 years), obese (BMI textgreater 30) or with multiple
  comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), caution is advised. Large, prospective studies
  are needed in the future to fully validate telemedical consultations in the fields
  of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.  Conclusion A telemedical examination of the
  hip joint and pelvis can be performed with certain limitations. Patient-specific
  factors such as age, BMI, and extent of comorbidities appear to have a relevant
  impact on validity and execution of the examination. Patients with multiple comorbidities
  (ASA 3 and above), advanced age (textgreater 75 years) or obesity (BMI textgreater
  30) should, whenever possible, be examined in a conventional outpatient setting.
