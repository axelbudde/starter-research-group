abstract: 'Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection is a global public health issue,
  that has now affected more than 200 countries worldwide and caused a second wave
  of pandemic. Severe adult respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is associated
  with a high risk of mortality. However, prognostic factors predicting poor clinical
  outcomes of individual patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia remain under intensive
  investigation. We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study of patients with
  SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to four hospitals in Wuhan, China from December 2019
  to February 2020. Mortality at the end of the follow up period was the primary outcome.
  Factors predicting mortality were also assessed and a prognostic model was developed,
  calibrated and validated. The study included 492 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were
  divided into three cohorts: the training cohort (n = 237), the validation cohort
  1 (n = 120), and the validation cohort 2 (n = 135). Multivariate analysis showed
  that five clinical parameters were predictive of mortality at the end of follow
  up period, including advanced age [odds ratio (OR), 1.1/years increase (p textless 0.001)],
  increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [(NLR) OR, 1.14/increase (p textless 0.001)],
  elevated body temperature on admission [OR, 1.53/°C increase (p = 0.005)], increased
  aspartate transaminase [OR, 2.47 (p = 0.019)], and decreased total protein [OR,
  1.69 (p = 0.018)]. Furthermore, the prognostic model drawn from the training cohort
  was validated with validation cohorts 1 and 2 with comparable area under curves
  (AUC) at 0.912, 0.928, and 0.883, respectively. While individual survival probabilities
  were assessed, the model yielded a Harrell’s C index of 0.758 for the training cohort,
  0.762 for the validation cohort 1, and 0.711 for the validation cohort 2, which
  were comparable among each other. A validated prognostic model was developed to
  assist in determining the clinical prognosis for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Using this
  established model, individual patients categorized in the high risk group were associated
  with an increased risk of mortality, whereas patients predicted to be in the low
  risk group had a higher probability of survival.'
