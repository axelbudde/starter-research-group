abstract: Two employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in England developed
  severe allergic reactions following administration of BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19
  (coronavirus disease 2019). The British SmPC for the BNT162b2 vaccine already includes
  reference to a contraindication for use in individuals who have had an allergic
  reaction to the vaccine or any of its components. As a precautionary measure, the
  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued interim guidance
  to the NHS not to vaccinate in principle in “patients with severe allergies”. Allergic
  reactions to vaccines are very rare, but vaccine components are known to cause allergic
  reactions. BNT162b2 is a vaccine based on an mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticles
  and blended with other substances to enable its transport into the cells. In the
  pivotal phase III clinical trial, the BNT162b2 vaccine was generally well tolerated,
  but this large clinical trial, used to support vaccine approval by the MHRA and
  US Food and Drug Administration, excluded individuals with a “history of a severe
  adverse reaction related to the vaccine and/or a severe allergic reaction (e.g.,
  anaphylaxis) to a component of the study medication”. Vaccines are recognized as
  one of the most effective public health interventions. This repeated administration
  of a foreign protein (antigen) necessitates a careful allergological history before
  each application and diagnostic clarification and a risk–benefit assessment before
  each injection. Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are rare but can be life-threatening,
  and it is prudent to raise awareness of this hazard among vaccination teams and
  to take adequate precautions while more experience is gained with this new vaccine.
