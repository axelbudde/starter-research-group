abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global challenge that substantially
  risks reversing the progress in ending HIV. At the same time, it may offer the opportunity
  for a new era of HIV management. This viewpoint presents the impact of COVID-19
  on HIV care, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) “three
  90s” targets. It outlines how to enhance a patient-centered care approach, now known
  as the \"fourth 90,” by integrating face-to-face patient–physician and telemedicine
  encounters. It suggests a framework for prevention and treatment of multimorbidity
  and frailty, to achieve a good health-related quality of life and preserve intrinsic
  capacity in all people living with HIV.
