abstract: Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded
  RNA genome. Currently, six human CoVs have been reported including human coronavirus
  229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute
  respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and MiddleEast respiratory syndrome
  (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). They cause moderate to severe respiratory and intestinal
  infections in humans. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the research
  and development of small-molecule anti-human coronavirus therapies targeting different
  stages of the CoV life cycle., Recent advances in the research and development of
  small-molecule anti-human coronavirus therapies.
