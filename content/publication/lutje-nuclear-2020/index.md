abstract: textlessptextgreaterThe current outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has reached
  multiple countries worldwide. While the number of newly diagnosed cases and fatalities
  is rising quickly, far-reaching measures were enacted to prevent further spread.
  Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, exposure history, PCR using specimens
  from the respiratory tract together with computed tomography (CT) imaging. One of
  the hallmarks of a critical course of COVID-19 is the development of severe acute
  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As management of COVID-19 can be considered
  a multi-disciplinary approach involving various medical specialties, we here review
  the first $^textrm18$F-FDG-PET/CT scans of COVID-19 to discuss how Nuclear Medicine
  could contribute to management of this disease.textless/ptextgreater
