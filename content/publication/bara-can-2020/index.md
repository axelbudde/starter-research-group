abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread all over the world and caused a
  major health care crisis. About 20% of patients develop severe disease and require
  hospitalisation, which is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 97% in
  those being ventilated and respiratory failure being the leading cause of death.
  Despite many therapeutic agents being under current investigation there is yet no
  panacea available. With increasing rates of infection throughout the world, there
  is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to counteract the infection., As
  the nervous system has shown to be a strong modulator of respiratory function and
  the immune response, we want to highlight pathways involved in regulation of respiratory
  function, the neuro-immune axis as well as the rationale for a potential targeted
  treatment of fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome via transcutaneous non-invasive
  vagal nerve stimulation in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.
