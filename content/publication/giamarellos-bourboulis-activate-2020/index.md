abstract: BCG vaccination in children protects against heterologous infections and
  improves survival independently of tuberculosis prevention. The phase III ACTIVATE
  trial assessed whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly. In this double-blind,
  randomized trial, elderly patients (n = 198) received BCG or placebo vaccine at
  hospital discharge and were followed for 12 months for new infections. At interim
  analysis, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection (median
  16 weeks compared to 11 weeks after placebo). The incidence of new infections was
  42.3% (95% CIs 31.9%–53.4%) after placebo vaccination and 25.0% (95% CIs 16.4%–36.1%)
  after BCG vaccination; most of the protection was against respiratory tract infections
  of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, p = 0.013). No difference in the frequency
  of adverse effects was found. Data show that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect
  the elderly against infections. Larger studies are needed to assess protection against
  respiratory infections, including COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03296423).
