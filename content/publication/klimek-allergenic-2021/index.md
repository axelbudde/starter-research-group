abstract: Following the emergency use authorization of the mRNA-1273 vaccine on the
  18thof December2020,two mRNAvaccinesare in current use for the prevention of coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID-19). For both mRNA vaccines, the phase IIIpivotal trials excluded
  individuals with a history of allergy tovaccine components.Immediately after the
  initiation of vaccination in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, anaphylactic
  reactions were reported. While the culprit trigger requires investigation, initial
  reports suggested the excipient polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG-2000) -contained in
  both vaccines as the PEG-micellar carrier system - as the potentialculprit. Surface
  PEG chains form a hydrate shell to increasestability and prevent opsonization. Allergic
  reactions to such PEGylated lipids can be IgE-mediated,but may alsoresult from complement
  activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) that has been described insimilar liposomes.
  In addition, mRNA-1273 also contains tromethamine (trometamol), which has been reported
  to cause anaphylaxis to substances such asgadolinium-based contrast media. Skin
  prick, intradermal and epicutaneoustests, in vitro sIgE assessment, evaluation ofsIgG/IgM,as
  well as basophil activation tests are being used to demonstrate allergic reactions
  to various components of the vaccines.
