abstract: Purpose The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has stressed health systems worldwide. Patients with
  chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more prone to a severe course of coronavirus
  disease (COVID-19) due to comorbidities and an altered immune system. The study’s
  aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients
  with CKD.  Methods We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the
  Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients
  with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using
  univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality
  were identified.  Results Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed
  a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be
  confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (textgreater 85 years
  compared to 15–65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27–33.20, p = 0.025).
  We further identified markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (textgreater 2 × upper
  limit of normal, aOR 23.21, 95% CI 3.66–147.11, p textless 0.001), thrombocytopenia
  (textless 120,000/µl, aOR 11.66, 95% CI 2.49–54.70, p = 0.002), anemia (Hb textless 10 g/dl,
  aOR 3.21, 95% CI 1.17–8.82, p = 0.024), and C-reactive protein (≥ 30 mg/l, aOR 3.44,
  95% CI 1.13–10.45, p = 0.029) as predictors, while renal replacement therapy was
  not related to mortality (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.68–1.93, p = 0.611).  Conclusion The
  identified predictors include routinely measured and universally available parameters.
  Their assessment might facilitate risk stratification in this highly vulnerable
  cohort as early as at initial medical evaluation for SARS-CoV-2.  Supplementary
