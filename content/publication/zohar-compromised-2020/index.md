abstract: textlessh2textgreaterSummarytextless/h2textgreatertextlessptextgreaterThe
  urgent need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has forced development to progress
  in the absence of well-defined correlates of immunity. While neutralization has
  been linked to protection against other pathogens, whether neutralization alone
  will be sufficient to drive protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the broader population
  remains unclear. Therefore, to fully define protective humoral immunity, we dissected
  the early evolution of the humoral response in 193 hospitalized individuals ranging
  from moderate to severe. Although robust IgM and IgA responses evolved in both survivors
  and non-survivors with severe disease, non-survivors showed attenuated IgG responses,
  accompanied by compromised Fc…£ receptor binding and Fc effector activity, pointing
  to deficient humoral development rather than disease-enhancing humoral immunity.
  In contrast, individuals with moderate disease exhibited delayed responses that
  ultimately matured. These data highlight distinct humoral trajectories associated
  with resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for early functional humoral
  immunity.textless/ptextgreater
