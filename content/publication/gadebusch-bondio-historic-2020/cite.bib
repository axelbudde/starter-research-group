 abstract = {This paper is part of Forum COVID-19: Perspectives in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) poses a huge challenge to the world community. Knowledge about the virus and its properties is limited, but there is a great need to base political and medical decisions on scientific knowledge. This situation is leading to a dynamization of research. A prominent example of such a development is SOLIDARITY. The epistemological dimensions of this trial, which is coordinated by the WHO, and the resulting ethical implications are discussed in this article.},
