abstract: 'This paper is part of Forum COVID-19: Perspectives in the Humanities and
  Social Sciences. The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) poses a huge challenge to the
  world community. Knowledge about the virus and its properties is limited, but there
  is a great need to base political and medical decisions on scientific knowledge.
  This situation is leading to a dynamization of research. A prominent example of
  such a development is SOLIDARITY. The epistemological dimensions of this trial,
  which is coordinated by the WHO, and the resulting ethical implications are discussed
  in this article.'
