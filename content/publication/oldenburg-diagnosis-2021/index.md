abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global healthcare crisis. Based on reports
  of atypically located thromboses following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19
  vaccine, the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research (GTH) has issued guidance
  statements on the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare complication.
  It shares pathophysiological features with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
  and is referred to as vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT).
