abstract: 'Lymphopenia is a key feature of immune dysfunction in patients with bacterial
  sepsis and COVID-19 and associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the cause is
  largely unknown. Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities,
  so-called non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and several studies have linked
  TSH and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic
  regulation and function of lymphocyte populations.To test the hypothesis that abnormal
  thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections.Retrospective
  analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3,
  albumin and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in two independent hospitalized
  study populations: bacterial sepsis (n=224) and COVID-19 patients (n=161). A subgroup
  analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte
  counts.Only T3 significantly correlated (rho=0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients
  with bacterial sepsis and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic
  compared to non-lympopenic patients (n=56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19
  patients (n=17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4
  and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (n=18), and demonstrated significantly
  increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and
  ferritin. Remarkably, after one week follow-up, the majority (12/15) of COVID-19
  patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, while TSH and
  thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed.Abnormal thyroid function correlates
  with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections, like bacterial sepsis and COVID-19,
  but future studies need to establish whether a causal relationship is involved.'
