abstract: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies and the differences in host response
  characterizing this variation have not been fully elucidated. COVID-19 disease severity
  correlates with an excessive pro-inflammatory immune response and profound lymphopenia.
  Inflammatory responses according to disease severity were explored by plasma cytokine
  measurements and proteomics analysis in 147 COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, peripheral
  blood mononuclear cell cytokine production assays and whole blood flow cytometry
  were performed. Results confirm a hyperinflammatory innate immune state, while highlighting
  hepatocyte growth factor and stem cell factor as potential biomarkers for disease
  severity. Clustering analysis reveals no specific inflammatory endotypes in COVID-19
  patients. Functional assays reveal abrogated adaptive cytokine production (interferon-gamma,
  interleukin-17 and interleukin-22) and prominent T cell exhaustion in critically
  ill patients, whereas innate immune responses were intact or hyperresponsive. Collectively,
  this extensive analysis provides a comprehensive insight into the pathobiology of
  severe to critical COVID-19 and highlight potential biomarkers of disease severity.
