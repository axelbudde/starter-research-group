abstract: The increased research on bat coronaviruses after severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  (MERS-CoV) allowed the very rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This is an excellent
  example of the importance of knowing viruses harbored by wildlife in general, and
  bats in particular, for global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens., Bats
  host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that rotavirus
  A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals
  and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their
  genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from
  Europe, Central America, and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA, and 11 of those were
  fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with
  publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs)
  were identified, which included evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes.
  Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear
  to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual
  human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic
  clustering, despite various levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them.
  Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research
  and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic.
  Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with
  Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest
  an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip
  of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further
  increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses.
