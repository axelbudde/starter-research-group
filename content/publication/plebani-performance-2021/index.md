abstract: This study assessed the diagnostic performance of the new COVID19SEROSpeed
  IgM/IgG rapid test (BioSpeedia, a spinoff of the Pasteur Institute of Paris) for
  the detection of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS-CoV-2) in comparison to other commercial antibody assays through a large
  cross-European investigation. The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 prepandemic
  sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders).
  The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2
  infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and
  whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests.
  The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients.
  The specificity of the test (BioS) on prepandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% confidence
  interval [CI], 96.2% to 99.4%). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS
  showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), with good
  concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohen’s kappa
  coefficient of 0.62). Due in part to simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG for both
  S1 and N proteins, BioS exhibited the highest positive percent agreement at ≥11
  days post-symptom onset (PSO). In conclusion, the BioS IgM/IgG rapid test was highly
  specific and demonstrated a higher positive percentage of agreement than all the
  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/chemiluminescence immunoassay (ELISA/CLIA) commercial
  tests considered in this study. Moreover, by detecting the presence of antibodies
  prior to 11 days PSO in 78.2% of the patients, the BioS test increased the efficiency
  of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the disease.
