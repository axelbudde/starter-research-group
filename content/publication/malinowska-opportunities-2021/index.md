abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may
  lead to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which, in turn, may be associated with
  multiple organ dysfunction. In this review, we present advantages and disadvantages
  of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid from the cannabis plant,
  as a potential agent for the treatment of COVID-19. CBD has been shown to downregulate
  proteins responsible for viral entry and to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Preclinical
  studies have demonstrated its effectiveness against diseases of the respiratory
  system as well as its cardioprotective, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective
  and anti-convulsant properties, that is, effects that may be beneficial for COVID-19.
  Only the latter two properties have been demonstrated in clinical studies, which
  also revealed anxiolytic and antinociceptive effects of CBD (given alone or together
  with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol), which may be important for an adjuvant treatment
  to improve the quality of life in patients with COVID-19 and to limit post-traumatic
  stress symptoms. However, one should be aware of side effects of CBD (which are
  rarely serious), drug interactions (also extending to drugs acting against COVID-19)
  and the proper route of its administration (vaping may be dangerous). Clearly, further
  clinical studies are necessary to prove the suitability of CBD for the treatment
  of COVID-19.
