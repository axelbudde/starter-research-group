abstract: 'Objective With the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, countless tests need to
  be performed on potential symptomatic individuals, contacts and travellers. The
  gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)–based system taking
  several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures,
  this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence
  community setting. Study design Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19
  screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously
  diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. Methods
  The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM–based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to
  result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. Results
  Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test
  detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27
  qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%). Conclusion
  Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to rely on an antibody-based rapid test
  for public health measures such as community screenings.'
