abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide
  health threat. In a prospective multicentric study, we identify IL-3 as an independent
  prognostic marker for the outcome during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specifically, low
  plasma IL-3 levels is associated with increased severity, viral load, and mortality
  during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit also reduced
  circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and low plasma IFNα and IFNλ levels
  when compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients. In a mouse model of pulmonary HSV-1
  infection, treatment with recombinant IL-3 reduces viral load and mortality. Mechanistically,
  IL-3 increases innate antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of circulating
  pDCs into the airways by stimulating CXCL12 secretion from pulmonary CD123+ epithelial
  cells, both, in mice and in COVID-19 negative patients exhibiting pulmonary diseases.
  This study identifies IL-3 as a predictive disease marker for SARS-CoV-2 infections
  and as a potential therapeutic target for pulmunory viral infections.
