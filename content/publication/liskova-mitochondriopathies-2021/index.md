abstract: The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the main site of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production in the cell. Although mitochondria possess a powerful antioxidant
  system, an excess of ROS cannot be completely neutralized and cumulative oxidative
  damage may lead to decreasing mitochondrial efficiency in energy production, as
  well as an increasing ROS excess, which is known to cause a critical imbalance in
  antioxidant/oxidant mechanisms and a “vicious circle” in mitochondrial injury. Due
  to insufficient energy production, chronic exposure to ROS overproduction consequently
  leads to the oxidative damage of life-important biomolecules, including nucleic
  acids, proteins, lipids, and amino acids, among others. Different forms of mitochondrial
  dysfunction (mitochondriopathies) may affect the brain, heart, peripheral nervous
  and endocrine systems, eyes, ears, gut, and kidney, among other organs. Consequently,
  mitochondriopathies have been proposed as an attractive diagnostic target to be
  investigated in any patient with unexplained progressive multisystem disorder. This
  review article highlights the pathomechanisms of mitochondriopathies, details advanced
  analytical tools, and suggests predictive approaches, targeted prevention and personalization
  of medical services as instrumental for the overall management of mitochondriopathy-related
  cascading pathologies.
