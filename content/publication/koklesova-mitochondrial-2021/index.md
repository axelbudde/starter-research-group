abstract: Mitochondrial injury plays a key role in the aetiopathology of multifactorial
  diseases exhibiting a “vicious circle” characteristic for pathomechanisms of the
  mitochondrial and multi-organ damage frequently developed in a reciprocal manner.
  Although the origin of the damage is common (uncontrolled ROS release, diminished
  energy production and extensive oxidative stress to life-important biomolecules
  such as mtDNA and chrDNA), individual outcomes differ significantly representing
  a spectrum of associated pathologies including but not restricted to neurodegeneration,
  cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Contextually, the role of predictive, preventive
  and personalised (PPPM/3P) medicine is to introduce predictive analytical approaches
  which allow for distinguishing between individual outcomes under circumstance of
  mitochondrial impairments followed by cost-effective targeted prevention and personalisation
  of medical services. Current article considers innovative concepts and analytical
  instruments to advance management of mitochondriopathies and associated pathologies.
