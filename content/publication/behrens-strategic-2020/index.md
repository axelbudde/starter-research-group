abstract: Background Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and
  to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular
  risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in
  regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist.  Methods
  In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments
  and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin
  G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation
  test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2.  Results From baseline to
  week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline
  HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom
  of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time
  (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6, p textless 0.001). In sera of convalescent
  patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels,
  obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
  using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as
  targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative
  incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal
  positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the
  eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed
  in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred
  without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed
  cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%.  Conclusion
  When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability,
  we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology
  tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology
  screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.  Trial Registration
