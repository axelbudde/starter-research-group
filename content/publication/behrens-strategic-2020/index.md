abstract: Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform
  individuals after suspected infection. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for
  infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with
  low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist.
