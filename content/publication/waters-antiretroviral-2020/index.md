abstract: The unprecedented global scale of COVID‐19 globally has triggered a race
  to discover interventions to reduce associated morbidity and mortality and rapid
  release of research findings prior to any degree of critical review. As with previous
  novel infection outbreaks, antiretrovirals are just one drug class that has been
  held up as a potential strategy for prophylaxis and treatment with scant evidence
  and risk of harm. Here we summarise the evidence for antiretrovirals to treat COVID‐19
  and, as a drug that has also been studied in HIV, hydroxychloroquine, and flag some
  of the pitfalls of using therapies that have not been evaluated robustly.
