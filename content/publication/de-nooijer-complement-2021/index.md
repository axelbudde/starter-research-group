abstract: Excessive activation of immune responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  is considered to be related to disease severity, complications, and mortality rate.
  The complement system is an important component of innate immunity and can stimulate
  inflammation, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown.A prospective, longitudinal, single
  center study was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Plasma concentrations
  of complement factors C3a, C3c, and terminal complement complex (TCC) were assessed
  at baseline and during hospital admission. In parallel, routine laboratory and clinical
  parameters were collected from medical files and analyzed.Complement factors C3a,
  C3c, and TCC were significantly increased in plasma of patients with COVID-19 compared
  with healthy controls (P &lt; .05). These complement factors were especially elevated
  in intensive care unit patients during the entire disease course (P &lt; .005 for
  C3a and TCC). More intense complement activation was observed in patients who died
  and in those with thromboembolic events.Patients with COVID-19 demonstrate activation
  of the complement system, which is related to disease severity. This pathway may
  be involved in the dysregulated proinflammatory response associated with increased
  mortality rate and thromboembolic complications. Components of the complement system
  might have potential as prognostic markers for disease severity and as therapeutic
  targets in COVID-19.
