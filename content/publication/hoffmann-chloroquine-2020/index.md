abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with
  more than 780,000 deaths worldwide (as of 20 August 2020). To develop antiviral
  interventions quickly, drugs used for the treatment of unrelated diseases are currently
  being repurposed to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that is
  used for the treatment of COVID-19 as it inhibits the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the
  African green monkey kidney-derived cell line Vero1–3. Here we show that engineered
  expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular protease that activates SARS-CoV-2 for entry into
  lung cells4, renders SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells insensitive to chloroquine.
  Moreover, we report that chloroquine does not block infection with SARS-CoV-2 in
  the TMPRSS2-expressing human lung cell line Calu-3. These results indicate that
  chloroquine targets a pathway for viral activation that is not active in lung cells
  and is unlikely to protect against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in and between patients.
