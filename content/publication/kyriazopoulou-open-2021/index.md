abstract: Background:. It was studied if early suPAR-guided anakinra treatment can
  prevent severe respiratory failure (SRF) of COVID-19. Methods:. A total of 130 patients
  with suPAR ≥6 ng/ml were assigned to subcutaneous anakinra 100 mg once daily for
  10 days. Primary outcome was SRF incidence by day 14 defined as any respiratory
  ratio below 150 mmHg necessitating mechanical or non-invasive ventilation. Main
  secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and inflammatory mediators; 28-day WHO-CPS
  was explored. Propensity-matched standard-of care comparators were studied. Results:.
  22.3% with anakinra treatment and 59.2% comparators (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI,
  0.20–0.46) progressed into SRF; 30-day mortality was 11.5% and 22.3% respectively
  (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.25–0.97). Anakinra was associated with decrease in
  circulating interleukin (IL)−6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was
  inversely associated with SOFA score; patients were allocated to less severe WHO-CPS
  strata. Conclusions:. Early suPAR-guided anakinra decreased SRF and restored the
  pro-/anti-inflammatory balance. Funding:. This study was funded by the Hellenic
  Institute for the Study of Sepsis, Technomar Shipping Inc, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum,
  and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Clinical trial number:. NCT04357366.
