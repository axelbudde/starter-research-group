abstract: In vitro-transcribed messenger RNA-based therapeutics represent a relatively
  novel and highly efficient class of drugs. Several recently published studies emphasize
  the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant
  and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail
  to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest
  as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation
  into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific
  T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability
  to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition
  may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This
  enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of
  epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes,
  thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape
  due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted
  by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the
  production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles
  such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually
  solved in the recent years., This review will summarize the most recent technological
  developments and application of mRNA vaccines in clinical trials and discusses the
  results, challenges and future directions with a special focus on the induced innate
  and adaptive immune responses.
