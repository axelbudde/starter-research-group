 abstract = {Childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors may be at risk for a severe course of COVID‐19. Little is known about the clinical course of COVID‐19 in CAYA cancer survivors, or if additional preventive measures are warranted. We established a working group within the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) to summarize existing evidence and worldwide recommendations regarding evidence about factors/conditions associated with risk for a severe course of COVID‐19 in CAYA cancer survivors, and to develop a consensus statement to provide guidance for healthcare practitioners and CAYA cancer survivors regarding COVID‐19.},
