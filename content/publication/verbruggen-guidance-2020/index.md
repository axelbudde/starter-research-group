abstract: Childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors may be at
  risk for a severe course of COVID‐19. Little is known about the clinical course
  of COVID‐19 in CAYA cancer survivors, or if additional preventive measures are warranted.
  We established a working group within the International Late Effects of Childhood
  Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) to summarize existing evidence and worldwide
  recommendations regarding evidence about factors/conditions associated with risk
  for a severe course of COVID‐19 in CAYA cancer survivors, and to develop a consensus
  statement to provide guidance for healthcare practitioners and CAYA cancer survivors
  regarding COVID‐19.
