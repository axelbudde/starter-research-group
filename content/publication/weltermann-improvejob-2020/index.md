abstract: Perceived high chronic stress is twice as prevalent among German general
  practitioners (GPs) and non-physician medical staff compared to the general population.
  The reasons are multi-factorial and include patient, practice, healthcare system
  and societal factors, such as multi-morbidity, the diversity of populations and
  innovations in medical care. Also, practice-related factors, like stressful patient-staff
  interactions, poor process management of waiting times and lack of leadership, play
  a role. This publicly funded study evaluates the effectiveness of the newly developed
  participatory, interdisciplinary, and multimodal IMPROVEjob intervention on improving
  job satisfaction among general practice personnel. The intervention aims at structural
  stress prevention with regard to working conditions and behavioural stress prevention
  for leaders and other practice personnel.
