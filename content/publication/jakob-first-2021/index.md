abstract: "PURPOSE: Knowledge regarding patients' clinical condition at severe acute\
  \ respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is sparse. Data in the\
  \ international, multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients\
  \ (LEOSS) cohort study may enhance the understanding of COVID-19. METHODS: Sociodemographic\
  \ and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the\
  \ LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations\
  \ between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated\
  \ vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: We included\
  \ 2155 patients, 59.7% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was\
  \ 66-85 years (39.6%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0%\
  \ (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association\
  \ between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary,\
  \ neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an\
  \ increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found.\
  \ Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age [46-65 years: adjusted odds\
  \ ratio (aOR): 1.73, 95% CI 1.25-2.42, p = 0.001; 66-85 years: aOR 1.93, 95% CI\
  \ 1.36-2.74, p textless 0.001; textgreater 85 years: aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.49-3.81,\
  \ p textless 0.001 vs. individuals aged 26-45 years], male sex (aOR 1.23, 95% CI\
  \ 1.01-1.50, p = 0.040), cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.72, p = 0.007),\
  \ and diabetes (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.69, p = 0.023) were associated with complicated\
  \ stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The LEOSS cohort identified age,\
  \ cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male sex as risk factors for complicated\
  \ disease stages at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, thus confirming previous data. Further\
  \ data regarding outcomes of the natural course of COVID-19 and the influence of\
  \ treatment are required."
