abstract: 'Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment
  of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases has faced major challenges.
  Recommendations for “social distancing” and the fear of patients becoming infected
  during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal
  doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically
  ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently
  understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with
  monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a
  severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy
  with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There
  is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of
  these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods:
  A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet
  to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 – April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language
  publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides
  recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated
  diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In order to maintain in-office consultation
  services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic
  situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients
  with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent
  infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently
  seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by
  slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable
  effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect
  during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there
  is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological
  directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected
  in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide
  experience-based instructions in the future. Conclusion: The use of biologicals
  for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis
  with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients
  without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is
  recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical
  monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control
  allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should
  avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven
  or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits
  and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved
  in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of
  biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical
  offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.'
