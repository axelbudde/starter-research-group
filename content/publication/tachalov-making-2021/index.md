abstract: 'An evident underestimation of the targeted prevention of dental diseases
  is strongly supported by alarming epidemiologic statistics globally. For example,
  epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population
  followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided
  oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including
  but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance
  in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important
  aspect is the “participatory” medicine based on the active participation of population
  in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient
  is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end,
  nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services
  suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk
  factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes
  in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension
  and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered
  oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health.
  Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between
  the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory
  and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces
  the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2,
  and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral
  hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation.
  Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal
  oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity
  under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender,
  socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality,
  regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility
  for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters
  for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex
  dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and
  adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care
  to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.'
