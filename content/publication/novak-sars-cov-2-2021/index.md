abstract: The pandemic condition coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the novel
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can take asymptomatic,
  mild, moderate, and severe courses. COVID-19 affects primarily the respiratory airways
  leading to dry cough, fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and diarrhea and can end
  up in interstitial pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. Reports about the manifestation
  of various skin lesions and lesions of the vascular system in some subgroups of
  SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as such features outside the respiratory sphere, are
  rapidly emerging. Vesicular, urticarial, and maculopapular eruptions and livedo,
  necrosis, and other vasculitis forms have been reported most frequently in association
  with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to update information gained, we provide a systematic
  overview of the skin lesions described in COVID-19 patients, discuss potential causative
  factors, and describe differential diagnostic evaluations. Moreover, we summarize
  current knowledge about immunologic, clinical, and histologic features of virus-
  and drug-induced lesions of the skin and changes to the vascular system in order
  to transfer this knowledge to potential mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2.
