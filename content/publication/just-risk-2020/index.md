abstract: 'Background Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health
  systems, citizens and policy makers worldwide. Early detection of affected patients
  within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is
  an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources,
  false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19.
  Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds
  ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting.  Methods
  We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical
  characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients
  in Germany.  Results In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received
  CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0–59.0)
  and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported
  anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51–13.67) for a positive test
  result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11–0.97).
  Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and
  showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16;
  95% CI: 1.72–15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were
  still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97–39.67).  Conclusions Several anamnestic
  criteria may be helpful to assess pre-test probability of COVID-19 in patients with
  common cold symptoms.  Supplementary Information Supplementary information accompanies
