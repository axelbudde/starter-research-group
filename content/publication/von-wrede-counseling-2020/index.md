abstract: • A structured audit on telemedical counseling was performed in 239 patients
  with epilepsy.   • Telemedicine was appreciated by textgreater 80% of the participants.   •
  Quality of telemedicine was rated equal to onsite appointments.   • Telemedicine
  is welcomed as an add-on service rather than a substitute to appointments onsite.
