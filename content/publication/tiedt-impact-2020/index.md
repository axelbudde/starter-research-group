abstract: Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have altered
  emergency workflows established to optimize the outcome of patients with large-vessel
  occlusion (LVO) stroke.  Aims We here analyzed workflow time intervals and functional
  outcomes of LVO patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy (ET) during the
  COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.  Methods We compared the frequency, pre- and intrahospital
  workflow time intervals, rates of reperfusion, and functional outcome of patients
  admitted from March 1st to May 31st 2020 with patients admitted during the same
  time interval in 2019 to 12 university and municipal hospitals across Germany (N = 795).  Results
  The number of LVO patients treated with ET between March to May 2020 was similar
  when compared to the same interval in 2019. Direct-to-center patients and patients
  admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 showed similar pre- and intrahospital
  workflow time intervals compared to patients admitted in 2019, except for a longer
  door-to-groin time in patients admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 (47 min
  vs 38 min, p = 0.005). Rates of reperfusion were not significantly different between
  2020 and 2019. Functional outcome at discharge of LVO patients treated in 2020 was
  not significantly different compared to patients treated in 2019.  Conclusion Pre-
  and intrahospital workflows, ET efficacy, and functional outcome of LVO patients
  treated with ET were not affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in our large cohort
  from centers across Germany.
