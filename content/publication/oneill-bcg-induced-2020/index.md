abstract: Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been reported to decrease
  susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, an effect proposed to be mediated
  by the general long-term boosting of innate immune mechanisms, also termed trained
  immunity. Here, we discuss the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG against viral
  infections and whether this vaccine may afford protection to COVID-19.
