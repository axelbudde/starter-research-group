abstract: 'Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is disrupting
  urology health-care worldwide. Reduced emergency room visits resulting in adverse
  outcomes have most recently been reported in pediatrics and cardiology. We aimed
  to compare patients with emergency room visits for pyelonephritis in 2019 (pre-COVID-19
  era) and within the first wave of pandemic in 2020 (COVID-19 era) with regard to
  the number of visits and severe adverse disease outcomes.  Methods We performed
  a retrospective multicentre study comparing characteristics and outcomes of patients
  with pyelonephritis, excluding patients with hydronephrosis due to stone disease,
  in 10 urology departments in Germany during a 1-month time frame in March and April
  in each 2019 and 2020.  Results The number of emergency room visits for pyelonephritis
  in the COVID-19 era was lower (44 patients, 37.0%) than in the pre-COVID-19 era
  (76 patients, 63.0%), reduction rate: 42.1% (p = 0.003). Severe adverse disease
  outcome was more frequent in the COVID-19 era (9/44 patients, 20.5%) than in the
  pre-COVID-19 era (5/76 patients, 6.6%, p = 0.046). In detail, 7 versus 3 patients
  needed monitoring (15.9 vs. 3.9%), 2 versus no patients needed intensive-care treatment
  (4.5 vs. 0%), 2 versus no patients needed drain placement (4.5 vs. 0%), 2 versus
  no patients had a nephrectomy (4.5 vs. 0%), and 2 versus 1 patient died (4.5 vs.
  1.3%).  Conclusion This report of collateral damage during COÂ­VID-19 showed that
  emergency room visits were decreased, and severe adverse disease outcomes were increased
  for patients with pyelonephritis in the COVID-19 era. Health authorities should
  set up information campaign programs actively encouraging patients to utilize emergency
  room services in case of severe symptoms specifically during the actual second wave
  of pandemic.'
