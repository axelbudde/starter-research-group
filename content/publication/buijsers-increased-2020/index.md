abstract: Reports suggest a role of endothelial dysfunction and loss of endothelial
  barrier function in COVID-19. It is well established that the endothelial glycocalyx-degrading
  enzyme heparanase contributes to vascular leakage and inflammation. Low molecular
  weight heparins (LMWH) serve as an inhibitor of heparanase. We hypothesize that
  heparanase contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and that heparanase may
  be inhibited by LMWH. To test this hypothesis, heparanase activity and heparan sulfate
  levels were measured in plasma of healthy controls (n = 10) and COVID-19 patients
  (n = 48). Plasma heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were significantly
  elevated in COVID-19 patients. Heparanase activity was associated with disease severity
  including the need for intensive care, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and creatinine
  levels. Use of prophylactic LMWH in non-ICU patients was associated with a reduced
  heparanase activity. Since there is no other clinically applied heparanase inhibitor
  currently available, therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular
  weight heparins should be explored.
