abstract: 'Background A subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a hyperinflammatory
  state. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be
  effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of
  anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically
  ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation.  Methods
  In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with
  anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory
  parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined
  and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day
  of anakinra in the control group. Analysis was performed for day − 10 to + 10 relative
  to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally,
  three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups,
  (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset
  of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for
  starting anakinra treatment.  Results Baseline patient characteristics and clinical
  parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. As a consequence of bias
  by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (p = 0.0002),
  ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the
  anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no relevant differences in
  kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decreases of
  clinical parameters, including temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02),
  and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0.003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine
  (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group.
  No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were
  observed between groups. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.  Conclusions
  Anakinra is effective in reducing clinical signs of hyperinflammation in critically
  ill COVID-19 patients. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to draw conclusion
  about the effects of anakinra on clinical outcomes.'
