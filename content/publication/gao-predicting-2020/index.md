abstract: textlessh3textgreaterAbstracttextless/h3textgreater textlessptextgreaterWe
  describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of Cytotoxic
  T Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from diverse pathogens, given a Human Leukocyte
  Antigen (HLA) genotype. The model was trained and tested on experimental data on
  the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection.
  The method is more accurate than publicly available models. Our model predicts that
  only a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to HLA molecules
  is immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are
  predicted to provide broad population coverage, but the immunogenic epitopes in
  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model predicts that
  several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to those contained in
  low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population. Thus, we suggest
  that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals
  prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.textless/ptextgreater
