abstract: A SARS-CoV2 super-spreading event occurred during carnival in a small town
  in Germany. Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community,
  this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate
  (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect
  information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The
  number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that
  of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5% (95% CI:[12.3%; 19.0%])
  were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community
  (3.1%). 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was
  0.36% (95% CI:[0.29%; 0.45%]) for the community and 0.35% [0.28%; 0.45%] when age-standardized
  to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection
  rate (21.3% versus 9.5%, p textless 0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative
  mean increase 1.6, p = 0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative
  for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places
  with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics. Whether the super-spreading
  event not only increases the infection rate but also affects the IFR requires further
  investigation.
