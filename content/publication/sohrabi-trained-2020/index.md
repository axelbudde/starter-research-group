abstract: COVID-19 is a severe health problem in many countries and has altered day-to-day
  life in the whole world. This infection is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and depending
  on age, sex and health status of the patient, it can present with variety of clinical
  symptoms such as mild infection, a very severe form or even asymptomatic course
  of the disease. Similarly to other viruses, innate immune response plays a vital
  role in protection against COVID-19. However, dysregulation of innate immunity could
  have a significant influence on the severity of the disease. Despite various efforts,
  there is no effective vaccine against the disease so far. Recent data have demonstrated
  that the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine could reduce disease severity and
  the burden of several infectious diseases in addition to targeting its primary focus
  tuberculosis. There is growing evidence for the concept of beneficial non-specific
  boosting of immune responses by BCG or other microbial compounds termed trained
  immunity, which may protect against COVID-19. In this manuscript, we review data
  on how the development of innate immune memory due to microbial compounds specifically
  BCG can result in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss possible
  mechanisms, challenges and perspectives of using innate immunity as an approach
  to reduce COVID-19 severity.
