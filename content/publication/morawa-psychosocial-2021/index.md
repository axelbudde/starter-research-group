abstract: 'Objective The aim of this cross-sectional web-based study was to examine
  self-reported mental distress, psychosocial burdens, working conditions and potential
  risk and protective factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19
  pandemic in health care workers (HCW). Methods In the largest survey on mental health
  of HCW conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (N = 8071 HCW), we
  investigated depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2), and anxiety symptoms
  (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, GAD-2), working conditions, and psychosocial burden
  of 3678 HCW of three health care professions in hospitals: physicians (n = 1061),
  nurses (n = 1275), and medical technical assistants (MTA, n = 1342). Results The
  prevalence of clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms was
  17.4% and 17.8% for physicians, 21.6% and 19.0% for nurses, and 23.0% and 20.1%
  for MTA, respectively. All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated
  PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the
  pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear
  regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated
  with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and
  less trust in colleagues in difficult situations at work. In addition, elevated
  anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19.
  Conclusion During the pandemic HCW demonstrated a lower burden of mental distress
  compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrates
  psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening
  and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated.'
