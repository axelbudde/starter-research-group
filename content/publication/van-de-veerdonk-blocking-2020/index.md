abstract: COVID-19 is an emerging disease that can manifest itself as asymptomatic
  or mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals, but in some,
  it can progress into severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
  Inflammation is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of severe infections
  and ARDS and evidence is emerging that the IL-1/IL-6 pathway is highly upregulated
  in patients with severe disease. These findings open new avenues for host-directed
  therapies in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and might in addition
  to antiviral treatment be enough to curb the currently unacceptably high morbidity
  and mortality associated with COVID-19.
