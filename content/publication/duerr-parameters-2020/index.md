abstract: Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 affect many organs, including the heart.
  Cardiovascular disease is a dominant comorbidity and prognostic factors predicting
  risk for critical courses are highly needed. Moreover, immunomechanisms underlying
  COVID-induced myocardial damage are poorly understood. Objective To elucidate prognostic
  markers to identify patients at risk. Results Only patients with pericardial effusion
  (PE) developed a severe disease course, and those who died could be identified by
  a high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio. Ten out of 19 COVID-19 patients presented with PE,
  7 (78%) of these had elevated APACHE-II mortality risk-score, requiring mechanical
  ventilation. At admission, PE patients showed signs of systemic and cardiac inflammation
  in NMR and impaired cardiac function as detected by transthoracic echocardiography
  (TTE), whereas parameters of myocardial injury e.g. high sensitive troponin-t (hs-TnT)
  were not yet increased. During the course of disease, hs-TnT rose in 8 of the PE-patients
  above 16 ng/l, 7 had to undergo ventilatory therapy and 4 of them died. FACS at
  admission showed in PE patients elevated frequencies of CD3+CD8+ T cells among all
  CD3+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of Tregs and CD14+HLA−DR+-monocytes. A high
  CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in PE patients, and was
  associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines. By contrast, patients
  without PE and PE patients with a low CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio neither had to be
  intubated, nor died. Conclusions PE predicts cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients.
  Therefore, TTE should be performed at admission. Immunological parameters for dysfunctional
  antiviral immunity, such as the CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio used here, supports risk
  assessment by predicting poor prognosis.
