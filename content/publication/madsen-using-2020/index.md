abstract: 'Objectives: The Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis
  is associated with non- specific protective effects against other infections, and
  significant reductions in all-cause morbidity and mortality have been reported.
  We aim to test whether BCG vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity
  of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers (HCW) and thus
  prevent work absenteeism.'
