abstract: Currently, there are no approved treatments for early disease stages of
  COVID-19 and few strategies to prevent disease progression after infection with
  SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
  convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate administered within 72 h of diagnosis
  of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult individuals with pre-existing risk factors at higher
  risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19. Camostat mesylate acts as an inhibitor
  of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and prevents the virus from entering the
  cell. CP represents another antiviral strategy in terms of passive immunization.
  The working hypothesis to be tested in the RES-Q-HR study is that the early use
  of CP or camostat mesylate reduces the likelihood of disease progression to (modified)
  WHO stages 4b-8 in SARS-CoV-2-positive adult patients at high risk of moderate or
  severe COVID-19 progression.
