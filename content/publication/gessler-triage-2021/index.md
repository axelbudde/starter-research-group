abstract: 'Objective: In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the associated
  hospitalization of an overwhelming number of ventilator-dependent patients, medical
  and/or ethical patient triage paradigms have become essential. While guidelines
  on the allocation of scarce resources do exist, such work within the subdisciplines
  of intensive care (e.g. neurocritical care) remains limited. Methods: A 16-item
  questionnaire was developed that sought to explore/quantify the expert opinions
  of German neurointensivists with regard to triage decisions. The anonymous survey
  was conducted via a web-based platform and in total, 96 members of the Initiative
  of German Neurointensive Trial Engagement (IGNITE)-study group were contacted via
  e-mail. The IGNITE consortium consists of an interdisciplinary panel of specialists
  with expertise in neuro-critical care (i.e. anesthetists, neurologists and neurosurgeons).
  Results: 50 members of the IGNITE consortium responded to the questionnaire; in
  total the respondents were in charge of more than 500 Neuro ICU beds throughout
  Germany. Common determinants reported which affected triage decisions included known
  patient wishes (98%), the state of health before admission (96%), SOFA-score (85%)
  and patient age (69%). Interestingly, other principles of allocation, such as a
  treatment of “youngest first” (61%) and members of the healthcare sector (50%) were
  also noted. While these were the most accepted parameters affecting the triage of
  patients, a “first-come, first-served” principle appeared to be more accepted than
  a lottery for the allocation of ICU beds which contradicts much of what has been
  reported within the literature. The respondents also felt that at least one neurointensivist
  should serve on any interdisciplinary triage team. Conclusions: The data gathered
  in the context of this survey reveal the estimation/perception of triage algorithms
  among neurointensive care specialists facing COVID-19. Further, it is apparent that
  German neurointensivists strongly feel that they should be involved in any triage
  decisions at an institutional level given the unique resources needed to treat patients
  within the Neuro ICU.'
