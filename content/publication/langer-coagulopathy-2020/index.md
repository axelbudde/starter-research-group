abstract: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is causing a global pandemic of life-threatening
  multiorgan disease, called COVID-19. Accumulating evidence indicates that patients
  with COVID-19 are at significant risk of thromboembolic complications, mainly affecting
  the venous, but also the arterial vascular system. While the risk of venous thromboembolism
  (VTE) appears to be higher in patients requiring intensive care unit support compared
  to those admitted to general wards, recent autopsy findings and data on the timing
  of VTE diagnosis relative to hospitalization clearly suggest that thromboembolic
  events also contribute to morbidity and mortality in the ambulatory setting. In
  addition to a severe hypercoagulable state caused by systemic inflammation and viral
  endotheliitis, some patients with advanced COVID-19 may develop a coagulopathy,
  which meets established laboratory criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation,
  but is not typically associated with relevant bleeding. Similar to other medical
  societies, the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research has issued empirical
  recommendations on initiation, dosing, and duration of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis
  in COVID-19 patients.
