abstract: "Given that a substantial proportion of the subgroup of COVID-19 patients\
  \ that face a severe disease course are younger than 60 years, it is critical to\
  \ understand the disease-specific characteristics of young COVID-19 patients. Risk\
  \ factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possible non-linear\
  \ influences remain unknown. Data were analyzed from COVID-19 patients with clinical\
  \ outcome in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan\
  \ 24th to Mar 27th. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected\
  \ from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic\
  \ regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear\
  \ influences, were performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of a severe\
  \ disease course. A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile\
  \ range [IQR] 38–55, range 18–60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly\
  \ patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical\
  \ disease course and the mean age was statistically significantly higher in the\
  \ severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p textless 0.001).\
  \ The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as\
  \ elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate\
  \ dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased lymphocyte counts influence disease severity\
  \ independently of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6,\
  \ 95% CI 2.41–122.3; p = 0.039) are particularly associated with the risk of developing\
  \ severe COVID-19 specifically in young patients, whereas no such influence seems\
  \ to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence\
  \ of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities.\
  \ Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random\
  \ forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences\
  \ of risk factors on disease severity. This study identified increased levels of\
  \ complement C3 as a unique risk factor for adverse outcomes specific to young COVID-19\
  \ patients."
