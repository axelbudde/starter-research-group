 abstract = {•
A laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2 was established.


•
It consists of minipool testing of nucleic acid preparations.


•
Limit of detection was 48 copies per reaction (95 % confidence interval: 33–184).


•
A protocol was distributed among five German university hospitals.


•
The approach proved its principle and one COVID-19 case was detected in 70 minipools.},
