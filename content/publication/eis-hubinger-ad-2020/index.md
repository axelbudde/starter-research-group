abstract: 'Background A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in late 2019 and subsequently caused a pandemic.
  Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally
  monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. Objectives We aimed to provide
  a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory-based surveillance tool
  for SARS-CoV-2. Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid
  extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and
  distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories.
  Results We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before
  the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020 to 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted
  positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-CoV-2 positive.
  This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2.
  Conclusions Our approach of a laboratory-based surveillance for SARSCoV-2 using
  minipools proved its concept is easily adaptable and resource-saving. It might assist
  not only public health laboratories in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.'
