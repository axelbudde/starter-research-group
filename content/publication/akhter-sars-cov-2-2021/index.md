abstract: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening complication arising from
  venous thromboembolism with a difficult diagnosis and treatment and is often associated
  with increased mortality and morbidity. PE had a significantly low incidence prior
  to the COVID-19 epidemic. This condition saw a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic,
  indicating an evident viral influence on PEâ€™s pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients.
  The hypercoagulable state induced by the viral load seems to be the major contributor,
  and the classical causative factors seem to play a lesser role. PE in COVID-19 infection
  has become a mammoth challenge since the diagnosis is quite challenging due to overlapping
  symptoms, lack of prior-known predisposing risk factors, limited resources, and
  viral transmittance risk. Numerous factors arising out of the viral load or treatment
  lead to an increased risk for PE in COVID-19 patients, besides the fact that certain
  unknown risk factors may also contribute to the incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients.
  The management of PE in COVID-19 infection mainly comprises thromboprophylaxis and
  anticoagulant therapy with mechanical ventilation, depending on the risk stratification
  of the patient, with a post-COVID-19 management that prevents recurrent PE and complications.
  This review aims to discuss various aspects of COVID-19-infection-associated PE
  and major differential aspects from non-COVID-19 PE.
