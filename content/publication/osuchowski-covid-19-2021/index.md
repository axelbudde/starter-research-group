abstract: The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide,
  with devastating consequences. While the medical community has gained insight into
  the epidemiology of COVID-19, important questions remain about the clinical complexities
  and underlying mechanisms of disease phenotypes. Severe COVID-19 most commonly involves
  respiratory manifestations, although other systems are also affected, and acute
  disease is often followed by protracted complications. Such complex manifestations
  suggest that SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the host response, triggering wide-ranging
  immuno-inflammatory, thrombotic, and parenchymal derangements. We review the intricacies
  of COVID-19 pathophysiology, its various phenotypes, and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 host
  response at the humoral and cellular levels. Some similarities exist between COVID-19
  and respiratory failure of other origins, but evidence for many distinctive mechanistic
  features indicates that COVID-19 constitutes a new disease entity, with emerging
  data suggesting involvement of an endotheliopathy-centred pathophysiology. Further
  research, combining basic and clinical studies, is needed to advance understanding
  of pathophysiological mechanisms and to characterise immuno-inflammatory derangements
  across the range of phenotypes to enable optimum care for patients with COVID-19.
