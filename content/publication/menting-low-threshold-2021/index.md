abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 4.7
  million infections greatly challenging healthcare workers (HCW) and medical institutions
  worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown to significantly impact mental and
  physical health of HCW. Thus, implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW
  are urgently needed. METHODS: A low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility was introduced
  at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, in March 2020. Irrespective of clinical
  symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore,
  employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact
  with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
  for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 h.
  Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded.
  RESULTS: Between 9th March and April 30, 2020, a total of 1510 employees were tested
  for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing
  facility. One percent (n = 11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18%
  being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%).
  Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56)
  were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. After risk contact tracking by the hospital hygiene
  6 patient-to-employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact
  to 55 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. CONCLUSION: In the absence of easily accessible
  public SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities
  in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected employees
  with absent or mild symptoms, thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable
  hospital environments. High levels of professional infection prevention training
  and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital
  hygiene network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in
  a pandemic setting.'
