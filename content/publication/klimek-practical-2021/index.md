abstract: For the preventive treatment of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
  an unprecedented global research effort studied the safety and efficacy of new vaccine
  platforms that have not been previously used in humans. Less than one year after
  the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU)
  as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so
  far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar
  lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ.
  Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare
  adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have
  triggered a high degree of uncertainty.
