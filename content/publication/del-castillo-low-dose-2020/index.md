abstract: Background The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has set the emergency services
  in developing countries on major alert, as the installed response capacities are
  easily overwhelmed by the constantly increasing high demand. The deficit of intensive
  care unit beds and ventilators in countries like Peru is forcing practitioners to
  seek preventive or early interventional strategies to prevent saturating these chronically
  neglected facilities.  Case presentation A 64-year-old patient is reported after
  presenting with COVID-19 pneumonia and rapidly progressing to deteriorated ventilatory
  function. Compassionate treatment with a single 1‑Gy dose to the bilateral whole-lung
  volume was administered, with gradual daily improvement of ventilatory function
  and decrease in serum inflammatory markers and oxygen support needs, including intubation.
  No treatment-related toxicity developed. Procedures of transport, disinfection,
  and treatment planning and delivery are described.  Conclusion Whole-lung low-dose
  radiotherapy seems to be a promising approach for avoiding or delaying invasive
  respiratory support. Delivered low doses are far from meeting toxicity ranges. On-going
  prospective trials will elucidate the effectiveness of this approach.
