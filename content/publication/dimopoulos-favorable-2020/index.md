abstract: Dysregulation of inflammation is hypothesized to play a crucial role in
  the severe complications of COVID-19, with the IL-1/IL-6 pathway being central.
  Here, we report on the treatment of eight severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients—seven
  hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece and one non-ICU patient in
  the Netherlands—with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra. All patients
  scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with
  secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia,
  hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury, and hepatobiliary dysfunction. At the end
  of treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved
  respiratory function, and lower HScore. Although three patients died, the mortality
  was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis. These data suggest
  that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients
  with sHLH as determined by the HScore, and they support the need for larger clinical
  studies to validate this concept.,    • Anakinra treatment was administered to eight
  severe COVID-19 patients   • All patients had secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis   •
  Respiratory function was improved at the end of treatment   • In one patient, the
  need for mechanical ventilation was prevented   , Complex immune dysregulation in
  severe COVID-19 suggests the use of immunomodulation therapies. Dimopoulos et al.
  describe eight cases of COVID-19 patients who all had secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
  and showed favorable responses in respiratory function upon treatment with the interleukin-1
  receptor antagonist Anakinra.
