abstract: T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells play an essential role in regulating the
  GC reaction and, consequently, the generation of high-affinity antibodies and memory
  B cells. Therefore, Tfh cells are critical for potent humoral immune responses against
  various pathogens and their dysregulation has been linked to autoimmunity and cancer.
  Tfh cell differentiation is a multistep process, in which cognate interactions with
  different APC types, costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways, as well as cytokines
  are involved. However, it is still not fully understood how a subset of activated
  CD4+ T cells begins to express the Tfh-defining chemokine receptor CXCR5 during
  the early stage of the immune response, how some CXCR5+ pre-Tfh cells enter the
  B-cell follicles and mature further into GC Tfh cells, and how Tfh cells are maintained
  in the memory compartment. In this review, we discuss recent advances on how cognate
  interactions and antigen are important for Tfh cell differentiation and long-term
  persistence of Tfh cell memory, and how this is relevant to the current understanding
  of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
