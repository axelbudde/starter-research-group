abstract: Background Video consultations could support patient care in hand surgery
  during social distancing in the COVID-19 era. According to the literature, images
  of hand and fingers can support telediagnosis in hand emergencies. We present this
  feasibility study on online video consultation in hand surgery.  Methods A structured
  examination was designed to query the medical history and examine motor skills,
  sensitivity, strength and function tests of the hand. Thirty examinations on both
  hands were carried out by online video consultation, then in direct contact and
  compared with each other.  Results With 4560 evaluated range of movement of the
  hand and finger joints, there was a high correlation between the measurement methods
  of R = 0.995 (p  Conclusion Online video consultation allows hand examination with
  sufficient documentation of hand and finger movements (range of motion) and proper
  evaluation of symptoms. It cannot replace direct examination but complement patient
  care in hand surgery even beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic.
