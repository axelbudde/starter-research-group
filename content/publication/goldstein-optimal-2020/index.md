abstract: 'Over the last decade, a rapid rise in deaths due to liver disease has been
  observed especially amongst young people. Nowadays liver disease accounts for approximately
  2 million deaths per year worldwide: 1 million due to complications of cirrhosis
  and 1 million due to viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Besides primary
  liver malignancies, almost all solid tumours are capable to spread metastases to
  the liver, in particular, gastrointestinal cancers, breast and genitourinary cancers,
  lung cancer, melanomas and sarcomas. A big portion of liver malignancies undergo
  palliative care. To this end, the paradigm of the palliative care in the liver cancer
  management is evolving from “just end of the life” care to careful evaluation of
  all aspects relevant for the survivorship. In the presented study, an evidence-based
  approach has been taken to target molecular pathways and subcellular components
  for modelling most optimal conditions with the longest survival rates for patients
  diagnosed with advanced liver malignancies who underwent palliative treatments.
  We developed an unsupervised machine learning (UML) approach to robustly identify
  patient subgroups based on estimated survival curves for each individual patient
  and each individual potential biomarker. UML using consensus hierarchical clustering
  of biomarker derived risk profiles resulted into 3 stable patient subgroups. There
  were no significant differences in age, gender, therapy, diagnosis or comorbidities
  across clusters. Survival times across clusters differed significantly. Furthermore,
  several of the biomarkers demonstrated highly significant pairwise differences between
  clusters after correction for multiple testing, namely, “comet assay” patterns of
  classes I, III, IV and expression rates of calgranulin A (S100), SOD2 and profilin—all
  measured ex vivo in circulating leucocytes. Considering worst, intermediate and
  best survival curves with regard to identified clusters and corresponding patterns
  of parameters measured, clear differences were found for “comet assay” and S100
  expression patterns. In conclusion, multi-faceted cancer control within the palliative
  care of liver malignancies is crucial for improved disease outcomes including individualised
  patient profiling, predictive models and implementation of corresponding cost-effective
  risks mitigating measures detailed in the paper. The “proof-of-principle” model
  is presented.'
