abstract: 'COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become pandemic. A
  further level of complexity opens up as soon as we look at diseases whose pathogenesis
  and therapy involve different immunological signaling pathways, which are potentially
  affected by COVID-19. Medical treatments must often be reassessed and questioned
  in connection with this infection. This article summarizes the current knowledge
  of COVID-19 in the light of major dermatological and allergological diseases. It
  identifies medical areas lacking sufficient data and draws conclusions for the management
  of our patients during the pandemic. We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin
  diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic
  dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective
  tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory
  skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering
  of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help
  with therapeutic decisions. Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation,
  our review may supply treatment recommendations and thoughtful considerations for
  disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here.'
