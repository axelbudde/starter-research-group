abstract: A number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidates have
  shown promising results, but substantial uncertainty remains regarding their effectiveness
  and global rollout. Boosting innate immunity with bacillus Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG)
  or other live attenuated vaccines may also play a role in the fight against the
  COVID-19 pandemic. BCG has long been known for its nonspecific beneficial effects
  that are most likely explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate
  immune cells, termed trained immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Rivas et al. add
  to these arguments by showing that BCG-vaccinated health care providers from a Los
  Angeles health care organization had lower rates of COVID-19 diagnoses and seropositivity
  compared with unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted
  to explore the effects of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. We posit that beyond COVID-19,
  vaccines such as BCG that elicit trained immunity may mitigate the impact of emerging
  pathogens in future pandemics.
