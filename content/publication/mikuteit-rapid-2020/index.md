abstract: 'Objective: During the early Covid 19 pandemic, undergraduate medical teaching
  of pediatric medicine had to be switched to online teaching at the Hanover Medical
  School (MHH). The aim was to develop an online module together with students., Methodology:
  In a multi-stage process, a working group consisting of lecturers and students developed
  the concept and implemented it. Afterwards the online module was evaluated., Results:
  The conceptualization process and the implementation of the module together with
  students can be represented as a modified PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act). We showed
  that including students in the development of an online module is helpful in times
  of limited resources e.g. such as personnel and time., Conclusion: The cooperation
  between students and lecturers is suitable for developing and implementing an online
  module in a short time. In the future, in addition to joint conceptualization phases,
  digital elements (e.g. preparatory webinars) for the module itself in attendance
  phases should be retained.'
