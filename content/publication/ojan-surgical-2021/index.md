abstract: Background The COVID-19 pandemic not only had an impact on public life and
  healthcare facilities in general, but also affected established surgical workflows
  for elective procedures. The strategy to protect patients and healthcare workers
  from infection by SARS-CoV-2 in surgical departments has needed step-by-step development.
  Based on the evaluation of international recommendations and guidelines, as well
  as personal experiences in a clinical “hot spot” and in a 450-bed surgical clinic,
  an adapted surgical site infection (SSI) prevention checklist was needed to develop
  concise instructions, which described roles and responsibilities of health care
  professionals that could be used for wider guidance in pandemic conditions. Method
  Publications of COVID-19-related recommendations and guidelines, produced by health
  authorities and organizations, such as WHO, US-CDC, ECDC, the American College of
  Surgery and the Robert Koch Institute, were retrieved, assessed and referenced up
  to January 31st, 2020. Additionally, clinical personal experiences in Germany were
  evaluated and considered. Results Part 1 of this guidance summarizes the experience
  of a tertiary care, surgical centre which utilised redundant hospital buildings
  for immediate spatial separation in a “hot spot” COVID-19 area. Part 2 outlines
  the successful screening and isolation strategy in a surgical clinic in a region
  of Germany with outbreaks in surrounding medical centres. Part 3 provides the synopsis
  of personal experiences and international recommendations suggested for implementation
  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Understanding of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-related
  epidemiology, is constantly and rapidly changing, requiring continuous adaptation
  and re-evaluation of recommendations. Established national and local guidelines
  for continuation of surgical services and prevention of SSI require ongoing scrutiny
  and focused implementation. This manuscript presents a core facility checklist to
  support medical institutions to continue their clinical and surgical work during
  the COVID-19 pandemic.
