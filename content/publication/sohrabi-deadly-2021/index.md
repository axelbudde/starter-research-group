abstract: Age is a key risk factor associated with the severity of symptoms caused
  by SARS-Co-V2 and there is an urgent need to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality
  in elderly individuals. We discuss evidence suggesting that trained immunity elicited
  by BCG vaccination may improve immune responses and can serve as a strategy to combat
  COVID-19 in this population.
