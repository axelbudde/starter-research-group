abstract: 'A double punch against SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal antibodies are an important
  weapon in the battle against COVID-19. However, these large proteins are difficult
  to produce in the needed quantities and at low cost. Attention has turned to nanobodies,
  which are aptly named, single-domain antibodies that are easier to produce and have
  the potential to be administered by inhalation. Koenig et al. describe four nanobodies
  that bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike
  protein and prevent infection of cells (see the Perspective by Saelens and Schepens).
  Structures show that the nanobodies target two distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2
  spike protein. Multivalent nanobodies neutralize virus much more potently than single
  nanobodies, and multivalent nanobodies that bind two epitopes prevent the emergence
  of viral escape mutants. Science, this issue p. eabe6230; see also p. 681 Structured
  Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe global scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose unprecedented challenges to society, health
  care systems, and science. In addition to effective and safe vaccines, passive immunization
  by antibody-related molecules offers an opportunity to harness the vertebrate immune
  system to fight viral infections in high-risk patients. Variable domains of heavy-chain–only
  antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, are suitable lead molecules in such
  efforts, as they are small, extremely stable, easy to engineer, and economic to
  produce in simple expression systems. RATIONALEWe engineered improved multivalent
  nanobodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of two principles: (i) detailed
  structural information of their epitopes and binding modes to the viral spike protein
  and (ii) mechanistic insights into viral fusion with cellular membranes catalyzed
  by the spike. RESULTSNanobodies specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
  SARS-CoV-2 spike were identified by phage display using nanobody libraries from
  an alpaca and a llama immunized with the RBD and inactivated virus. Four of the
  resulting nanobodies—VHHs E, U, V, and W—potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2–pseudotyped
  vesicular stomatitis virus. X-ray crystallography revealed that the nanobodies bind
  to two distinct epitopes on the RBD, interfaces “E” and “UVW,” which can be synergistically
  targeted by combinations of nanobodies to inhibit infection. Cryo–electron microscopy
  (cryo-EM) of trimeric spike in complex with VHH E and VHH V revealed that VHH E
  stabilizes a conformation of the spike with all three RBDs in the “up” conformation
  (3-up), a state that is typically associated with activation by receptor binding.
  In line with this observation, we found that VHH E triggers the fusion activity
  of spike in the absence of the cognate receptor ACE2. VHH V, by contrast, stabilizes
  spike in a 2-up conformation and does not induce fusion. On the basis of the structural
  information, we designed bi- and trivalent nanobodies with improved neutralizing
  properties. VHH EEE most potently inhibited infection, did not activate fusion,
  and likely inactivated virions by outcompeting interaction of the virus with its
  receptor. Yet evolution experiments revealed emergence of escape mutants in the
  spike with single–amino acid changes that were completely insensitive to inhibition
  by VHH EEE. VHH VE also neutralized more efficiently than VHH E or VHH V alone;
  stabilized the 3-up conformation of spike, as determined by cryo-EM; and more strongly
  induced the spike fusogenic activity. We conclude that the premature activation
  of the fusion machinery on virions was an unexpected mechanism of neutralization,
  as enhanced neutralization could not be attributed simply to better blocking of
  virus-receptor interactions. Activation of spike in the absence of target membranes
  likely induces irreversible conformational changes to assume the energetically favorable
  postfusion conformation without catalyzing fusion per se. Simultaneous targeting
  of two independent epitopes by VHH VE largely prevented the emergence of resistant
  escape mutants in evolution experiments. CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate the strength
  of the modular combination of nanobodies for neutralization. Premature activation
  of spike by nanobodies reveals an unusual mode of neutralization and yields insights
  into the mechanism of fusion. textlessimg class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\"

  neutralize by inducing postfusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike.On virions,
  SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers are mostly in an inactive configuration with all RBDs in
  the down conformation (left). Binding of bivalent nanobody VE stabilizes the spike
  in an active conformation with all RBDs up (middle), triggering premature induction
  of the postfusion conformation, which irreversibly inactivates the spike protein
  (right). The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
  (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, with devastating consequences. For passive immunization
  efforts, nanobodies have size and cost advantages over conventional antibodies.
  In this study, we generated four neutralizing nanobodies that target the receptor
  binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used x-ray crystallography and
  cryo–electron microscopy to define two distinct binding epitopes. On the basis of
  these structures, we engineered multivalent nanobodies with more than 100 times
  the neutralizing activity of monovalent nanobodies. Biparatopic nanobody fusions
  suppressed the emergence of escape mutants. Several nanobody constructs neutralized
  through receptor binding competition, whereas other monovalent and biparatopic nanobodies
  triggered aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery. These premature conformational
  changes in the spike protein forestalled productive fusion and rendered the virions
  noninfectious. SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing nanobodies were combined to design potent
  multivalent nanobodies. SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing nanobodies were combined to design
  potent multivalent nanobodies.'
