abstract: Background Currently available coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines
  are approved for intramuscular injection and efficacy may not be ensured when given
  subcutaneously. For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients
  with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the
  application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed.  Methods The Delphi methodology was
  used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was
  prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus
  was defined as ≥75% agreement and strong consensus as ≥95% agreement, and agreement
  as a score ≥7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements
  was compiled.  Recommendations Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed
  only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia
  patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with
  a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII
  and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor
  IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus
  was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater
  than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need
  factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after
  vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a
  hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive
  replacement therapy until symptoms disappear.  Conclusions Consensus was achieved
  on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy
  for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity.
