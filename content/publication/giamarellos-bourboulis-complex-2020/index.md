abstract: Proper management of COVID-19 mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis.
  The sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset suggests
  that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern
  of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of
  whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome
  (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied
  by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK)
  cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating
  monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza.
  SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored
  by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was
  accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of
  immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR
  expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.
