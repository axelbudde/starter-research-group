abstract: 'The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens global
  health thereby causing unprecedented social, economic, and political disruptions.
  One way to prevent such a pandemic is through interventions at the human-animal-environment
  interface by using an integrated One Health (OH) approach. This systematic literature
  review documented the three coronavirus outbreaks, i.e. SARS, MERS, COVID-19, to
  evaluate the evolution of the OH approach, including the identification of key OH
  actions taken for prevention, response, and control. The OH understandings identified
  were categorized into three distinct patterns: institutional coordination and collaboration,
  OH in action/implementation, and extended OH (i.e. a clear involvement of the environmental
  domain). Across all studies, OH was most often framed as OH in action/implementation
  and least often in its extended meaning. Utilizing OH as institutional coordination
  and collaboration and the extended OH both increased over time. OH actions were
  classified into twelve sub-groups and further categorized as classical OH actions
  (i.e. at the human-animal interface), classical OH actions with outcomes to the
  environment, and extended OH actions. The majority of studies focused on human-animal
  interaction, giving less attention to the natural and built environment. Different
  understandings of the OH approach in practice and several practical limitations
  might hinder current efforts to achieve the operationalization of OH by combining
  institutional coordination and collaboration with specific OH actions. The actions
  identified here are a valuable starting point for evaluating the stage of OH development
  in different settings. This study showed that by moving beyond the classical OH
  approach and its actions towards a more extended understanding, OH can unfold its
  entire capacity thereby improving preparedness and mitigating the impacts of the
  next outbreak.'
