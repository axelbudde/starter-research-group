abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection is mild in the majority of individuals but progresses
  into severe pneumonia in a small proportion of patients. The increased susceptibility
  to severe disease in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities argues for
  an initial defect in anti-viral host defense mechanisms. Long-term boosting of innate
  immune responses, also termed “trained immunity,” by certain live vaccines (BCG,
  oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections
  through epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional reprogramming of innate immune
  cells. We propose that induction of trained immunity by whole-microorganism vaccines
  may represent an important tool for reducing susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2.
