abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unparalleled pursuit of vaccines to induce
  specific adaptive immunity, based on virus-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses.
  Although several vaccines have been developed just a year after SARS-CoV-2 emerged
  in late 2019, global deployment will take months or even years. Meanwhile, the virus
  continues to take a severe toll on human life and exact substantial economic costs.
  Innate immunity is fundamental to mammalian host defense capacity to combat infections.
  Innate immune responses, triggered by a family of pattern recognition receptors,
  induce interferons and other cytokines and activate both myeloid and lymphoid immune
  cells to provide protection against a wide range of pathogens. Epidemiological and
  biological evidence suggests that the live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) targeting tuberculosis,
  measles, and polio induce protective innate immunity by a newly described form of
  immunological memory termed “trained immunity.” An LAV designed to induce adaptive
  immunity targeting a particular pathogen may also induce innate immunity that mitigates
  other infectious diseases, including COVID-19, as well as future pandemic threats.
  Deployment of existing LAVs early in pandemics could complement the development
  of specific vaccines, bridging the protection gap until specific vaccines arrive.
  The broad protection induced by LAVs would not be compromised by potential antigenic
  drift (immune escape) that can render viruses resistant to specific vaccines. LAVs
  might offer an essential tool to “bend the pandemic curve,” averting the exhaustion
  of public health resources and preventing needless deaths and may also have therapeutic
  benefits if used for postexposure prophylaxis of disease.
