abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in patients with
  chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both conditions are rising in incidence as well as
  prevalence, creating poor outcomes for patients and high healthcare costs. Recent
  data suggests CKD to be an independent risk factor for CVD. Accumulation of uremic
  toxins, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress have been identified to act as
  CKD-specific alterations that increase cardiovascular risk. The association between
  CKD and cardiovascular mortality is markedly influenced through vascular alterations,
  in particular atherosclerosis and vascular calcification (VC). While numerous risk
  factors promote atherosclerosis by inducing endothelial dysfunction and its progress
  to vascular structural damage, CKD affects the medial layer of blood vessels primarily
  through VC. Ongoing research has identified VC to be a multifactorial, cell-mediated
  process in which numerous abnormalities like mineral dysregulation and especially
  hyperphosphatemia induce a phenotype switch of vascular smooth muscle cells to osteoblast-like
  cells. A combination of pro-calcifying stimuli and an impairment of inhibiting mechanisms
  like fetuin A and vitamin K-dependent proteins like matrix Gla protein and Gla-rich
  protein leads to mineralization of the extracellular matrix. In view of recent studies,
  intercellular communication pathways via extracellular vesicles and microRNAs represent
  key mechanisms in VC and thereby a promising field to a deeper understanding of
  the involved pathomechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview about pathophysiological
  mechanisms connecting CKD and CVD. Special emphasis is laid on vascular alterations
  and more recently discovered molecular pathways which present possible new therapeutic
  targets.
