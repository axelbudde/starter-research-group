abstract: After the lockdown and the end of the summer holidays, day-cares and schools
  need to be reopened and (despite the continued circulation of the new coronavirus
  SARS-CoV-2) kept open. The need for opening up arises from the right of children
  to education, participation, support and care. This is possible if appropriate hygiene
  measures are implemented and community transmission remains stable. In addition,
  the safety of educators, teachers and carers must be a priority and needs to be
  addressed by appropriate measures. Finally, the needs of families must also be taken
  into account. The following document describes in detail how these objectives can
  be achieved.
