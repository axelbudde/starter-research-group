abstract: The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech
  was the first registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective
  in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad effects of
  the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have combined effects on
  innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination
  of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several
  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated
  the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation
  with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli.
  The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2
  vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion,
  the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune
  responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class
  of vaccines.
